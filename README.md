**blowup** is a command-line interface (CLI) tool designed to streamline and automate the technical aspects of my film-watching experience, from managing movie trackers to handling subtitle files.

It's a personal project born out of a passion for cinema and a desire to solve common technical frustrations, so I can spend more time enjoying the art itself.

## ‚ú® Features

### Current Features:

* Tracker Management: Download the latest tracker list from a specific GitHub repository.
* Subtitle Stream Management:
  * List available subtitle streams within a video container (requires ffprobe).
  * Export a specific subtitle stream from a video container to an SRT file (requires ffmpeg).
* SRT Subtitle Manipulation:
  * Shift all timestamps in an SRT subtitle file by a specified time offset.
  * Interactively compare and synchronize two SRT subtitle files.

### Planned Features:

* Flexible Tracker Sources: Support fetching tracker lists from multiple sources, including various GitHub repositories and direct URLs.
* Local Subtitle Translation: Translate subtitle files using a local large language model (LLM).

## üí° Motivation

The core inspiration behind blowup came from my personal film-watching workflow. I often found myself spending an excessive amount of time on repetitive tasks, such as manually updating torrent trackers or correcting subtitle synchronization.

This project is an attempt to automate these chores, making the technical part of movie-watching seamless, so the focus can remain on the story, cinematography, and performances.
