1
00:01:29,027 --> 00:01:30,696
We're screwed.

2
00:01:30,904 --> 00:01:32,281
No more free wi-fi.

3
00:01:34,032 --> 00:01:34,783
Hey, Ki-jung!

4
00:01:35,033 --> 00:01:35,784
Yeah?

5
00:01:36,243 --> 00:01:40,205
The lady upstairs
put a password on 'iptime'.

6
00:01:40,414 --> 00:01:41,874
A password?

7
00:01:42,249 --> 00:01:43,876
Did you try 123456789?

8
00:01:44,001 --> 00:01:45,085
No luck.

9
00:01:45,127 --> 00:01:46,587
Do it the other way.

10
00:01:46,628 --> 00:01:48,005
I tried that too!

11
00:01:48,130 --> 00:01:52,301
Fuck, then we can't get WhatsApp?

12
00:01:52,426 --> 00:01:53,302
Nothing.

13
00:01:54,219 --> 00:01:56,096
Hey, Kim Ki-taek.

14
00:01:56,930 --> 00:02:00,100
Don't fucking pretend to sleep.
What do you think?

15
00:02:00,934 --> 00:02:06,690
Our phones are shut off.
Now our wi-fi is shut off.

16
00:02:07,274 --> 00:02:10,319
What's your plan?

17
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:14,114
- Ki-woo.
- Yes, Dad?

18
00:02:14,281 --> 00:02:17,826
For wi-fi, hold it high.

19
00:02:19,286 --> 00:02:23,040
Stick it in every corner
and so on.

20
00:02:26,877 --> 00:02:30,631
Damn stink bugs.

21
00:02:31,548 --> 00:02:33,634
Over here! I got it!

22
00:02:33,801 --> 00:02:35,219
Really? You got a signal?

23
00:02:35,260 --> 00:02:36,929
Yeah, see?

24
00:02:37,179 --> 00:02:39,640
This one,
'coffeeland 2G'.

25
00:02:39,890 --> 00:02:41,725
Did a new cafe open?

26
00:02:41,975 --> 00:02:43,560
Why can't I get it?

27
00:02:43,685 --> 00:02:45,270
Climb up here.

28
00:02:45,395 --> 00:02:46,355
Hey kids.

29
00:02:47,481 --> 00:02:48,148
Does it work?

30
00:02:48,190 --> 00:02:49,066
Yeah.

31
00:02:49,191 --> 00:02:51,443
Then check WhatsApp.

32
00:02:52,110 --> 00:02:54,279
Pizza Generation
said they'd contact me.

33
00:02:54,905 --> 00:02:56,240
Hold on.

34
00:02:56,907 --> 00:02:59,076
Here it is.
Pizza Generation.

35
00:03:02,412 --> 00:03:05,874
Wow!
Check this out, guys.

36
00:03:06,333 --> 00:03:09,461
If we go as fast as her,
we can finish today.

37
00:03:09,628 --> 00:03:10,879
Then we can get paid.

38
00:03:10,921 --> 00:03:14,091
- Should we stand up too?
- She's a pro.

39
00:03:14,591 --> 00:03:17,177
What? Fumigation?

40
00:03:19,221 --> 00:03:20,681
They still do that kind of thing?

41
00:03:20,806 --> 00:03:21,765
Guess so.

42
00:03:21,849 --> 00:03:22,599
Shut the window.

43
00:03:22,724 --> 00:03:25,185
Leave it open.
We'll get free extermination.

44
00:03:25,310 --> 00:03:26,687
Kill the stink bugs.

45
00:03:27,104 --> 00:03:29,606
Right, too many
stink bugs these days...

46
00:03:32,025 --> 00:03:34,069
God, that smells!

47
00:03:36,822 --> 00:03:38,407
I told you to shut it!

48
00:03:38,740 --> 00:03:40,492
Should I shut it, Dad?

49
00:03:51,378 --> 00:03:53,130
What exactly is the problem?

50
00:03:54,381 --> 00:03:57,217
Take this one as an example.

51
00:03:57,467 --> 00:03:59,428
You call this a straight line?

52
00:04:00,053 --> 00:04:01,930
And why's it folded here?

53
00:04:02,264 --> 00:04:03,640
Why is this sticking up?

54
00:04:04,057 --> 00:04:06,435
You didn't even fold it.

55
00:04:07,561 --> 00:04:11,315
A quarter of them look like this.

56
00:04:11,565 --> 00:04:13,734
So 1 out of 4 are rejects.

57
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:21,033
So you're really docking
10% off our pay?

58
00:04:21,491 --> 00:04:24,828
Considering the rejects,
that's a low penalty, isn't it?

59
00:04:25,996 --> 00:04:28,957
Our pay is so low already!
How can you do this?

60
00:04:31,168 --> 00:04:32,252
Look here.

61
00:04:32,711 --> 00:04:35,130
This is not some minor issue.

62
00:04:35,297 --> 00:04:40,052
You know what one shitty box
can do to our brand image?

63
00:04:40,093 --> 00:04:43,889
Brand? You can't even
afford a box folder!

64
00:04:44,014 --> 00:04:45,182
What did you say?

65
00:04:46,391 --> 00:04:47,267
Boss.

66
00:04:48,435 --> 00:04:49,895
This is all because
of that guy, right?

67
00:04:49,937 --> 00:04:50,854
What guy?

68
00:04:50,938 --> 00:04:54,691
Your part-time worker.
He's gone AWOL, right?

69
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:58,070
Just when the Love of God Church
made a huge group order?

70
00:04:58,111 --> 00:05:00,906
How do you know all that?

71
00:05:01,406 --> 00:05:02,658
Who told you?

72
00:05:03,033 --> 00:05:04,785
My sister knows the guy.

73
00:05:05,118 --> 00:05:09,373
He's always been a bit strange.
Got a bad reputation.

74
00:05:09,748 --> 00:05:11,500
Speaking of which, Boss.

75
00:05:12,334 --> 00:05:14,503
We'll accept a 10% penalty.

76
00:05:14,544 --> 00:05:15,420
In return...

77
00:05:15,629 --> 00:05:16,588
In return?

78
00:05:17,130 --> 00:05:19,591
Any thought of hiring
a new part-time worker?

79
00:05:19,716 --> 00:05:23,095
Sis, we need someone!

80
00:05:23,637 --> 00:05:26,723
Ditch the guy you've got now.
Just fire him.

81
00:05:27,474 --> 00:05:30,602
Tomorrow I'll come for
a formal interview. What time?

82
00:05:30,769 --> 00:05:32,229
Wait, hold on a sec.

83
00:05:33,230 --> 00:05:35,107
Let me think about it.

84
00:05:35,774 --> 00:05:38,944
Then for now,
just pay for the boxes.

85
00:05:45,575 --> 00:05:48,954
So we're all gathered here today,

86
00:05:49,579 --> 00:05:52,916
to celebrate the
reconnection of our phones,

87
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,712
and this bounteous wi-fi!

88
00:05:56,962 --> 00:06:00,132
Look at that bastard.
It's not even dark yet.

89
00:06:00,966 --> 00:06:04,636
Why didn't you put up a
'No Urinating' sign?

90
00:06:04,803 --> 00:06:05,554
I told you!

91
00:06:05,595 --> 00:06:09,641
No, signs like that just make
them piss even more.

92
00:06:10,475 --> 00:06:12,352
At least shout at him!

93
00:06:12,394 --> 00:06:13,645
Don't shout.

94
00:06:14,104 --> 00:06:15,939
"Please don't piss!"

95
00:06:17,816 --> 00:06:20,569
Hey, is that Min?

96
00:06:21,319 --> 00:06:23,488
Hey mister,
that's not a toilet.

97
00:06:23,613 --> 00:06:24,990
Way to go, Min.

98
00:06:25,032 --> 00:06:27,159
Hey, punk!

99
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:30,078
Who are you staring at,
asshole?

100
00:06:30,537 --> 00:06:33,749
Come here!
You little shit.

101
00:06:35,709 --> 00:06:37,794
Get a fucking grip!

102
00:06:39,004 --> 00:06:41,298
That's an impressive friend.

103
00:06:41,339 --> 00:06:44,176
College students have
a real vigor to them.

104
00:06:44,509 --> 00:06:45,385
Not like my brother.

105
00:06:45,552 --> 00:06:48,805
But is he coming here?
Did you invite him?

106
00:06:49,056 --> 00:06:49,765
No.

107
00:06:50,223 --> 00:06:51,183
Hello!

108
00:06:51,349 --> 00:06:52,684
Oh hi, Min!

109
00:06:53,310 --> 00:06:54,186
Min!

110
00:06:54,227 --> 00:06:55,103
Are you well, sir?

111
00:06:55,145 --> 00:06:57,689
- Sure.
- What are you doing here?

112
00:06:57,731 --> 00:06:59,191
I texted you.
Didn't you see it?

113
00:06:59,941 --> 00:07:01,026
Sorry, were you eating?

114
00:07:01,234 --> 00:07:02,486
No, we weren't eating.

115
00:07:02,527 --> 00:07:04,696
- How are you, Ki-jung?
- Fine, you too?

116
00:07:04,863 --> 00:07:07,532
We could've met outside,
why come here?

117
00:07:07,741 --> 00:07:08,533
Because of this.

118
00:07:08,575 --> 00:07:11,328
It's for you,
but it's so heavy.

119
00:07:11,536 --> 00:07:13,497
Really?
Put it down here.

120
00:07:15,832 --> 00:07:17,334
Wow, what is that?

121
00:07:17,584 --> 00:07:19,127
When I said I was meeting Ki-woo,

122
00:07:19,252 --> 00:07:22,130
my grandfather insisted
I bring this to you.

123
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:28,845
Is this a landscape type?

124
00:07:30,347 --> 00:07:32,224
Or you can see it as
an abstract type.

125
00:07:32,265 --> 00:07:33,850
Wow, you know these!

126
00:07:34,101 --> 00:07:38,063
My grandpa has collected
scholar's rocks since his cadet days.

127
00:07:38,188 --> 00:07:41,650
Now the annex, the study,
every room in the house

128
00:07:41,858 --> 00:07:43,819
is filled with these things.

129
00:07:43,902 --> 00:07:47,864
But this stone here is said to
bring material wealth to families...

130
00:07:47,906 --> 00:07:48,865
Min!

131
00:07:49,407 --> 00:07:52,327
This is so metaphorical.

132
00:07:52,619 --> 00:07:55,664
For sure.
It's a very opportune gift.

133
00:07:55,997 --> 00:07:56,748
Of course.

134
00:07:56,790 --> 00:08:00,544
Please relay our deepest thanks
to your grandpa.

135
00:08:01,294 --> 00:08:02,838
Food would be better.

136
00:08:12,931 --> 00:08:15,892
What was that called?
A landscape stone?

137
00:08:16,226 --> 00:08:17,561
You collect those rocks too?

138
00:08:17,644 --> 00:08:22,065
Hey, thanks to that rock I saw
your parents, they look healthy.

139
00:08:23,650 --> 00:08:27,571
They're plenty healthy,
just out of work.

140
00:08:30,031 --> 00:08:32,617
Is Ki-jung taking lessons
these days?

141
00:08:33,451 --> 00:08:36,204
She can't afford lessons.

142
00:08:45,172 --> 00:08:46,423
Cute, huh?

143
00:08:47,465 --> 00:08:49,926
She's the one you're tutoring?

144
00:08:50,051 --> 00:08:52,220
Park Da-hye.
High school sophomore.

145
00:08:52,637 --> 00:08:55,640
You take over as her English tutor.

146
00:08:56,349 --> 00:08:57,225
What do you mean?

147
00:08:57,350 --> 00:08:59,519
Tutor a rich kid.
It pays well.

148
00:09:00,770 --> 00:09:01,938
She's a nice girl.

149
00:09:02,147 --> 00:09:05,150
Look after her while
I'm studying abroad.

150
00:09:05,942 --> 00:09:09,237
What about your
university friends?

151
00:09:09,487 --> 00:09:12,741
Why ask a loser like me?

152
00:09:13,283 --> 00:09:14,659
Why do you think?

153
00:09:15,452 --> 00:09:17,621
Just the thought makes me sick.

154
00:09:17,704 --> 00:09:21,833
Those disgusting frat boys
slavering over Da-hye?

155
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,960
It's revolting.

156
00:09:29,799 --> 00:09:30,967
You like her?

157
00:09:36,014 --> 00:09:38,183
Hey, I'm serious.

158
00:09:39,476 --> 00:09:43,647
When she enters university,
I'll officially ask her out.

159
00:09:44,105 --> 00:09:45,857
So you take care of her
until then.

160
00:09:45,982 --> 00:09:50,153
If it's you,
I can leave in peace.

161
00:09:51,696 --> 00:09:54,366
Thanks for your trust,

162
00:09:54,824 --> 00:09:58,286
but do I have to pretend
to be a college student?

163
00:09:59,996 --> 00:10:02,791
Ki-woo, think about it.

164
00:10:03,541 --> 00:10:07,003
For years including
your military service,

165
00:10:07,212 --> 00:10:09,214
you took the university
entrance exam 4 times.

166
00:10:09,631 --> 00:10:12,300
Grammar, vocabulary,
composition, conversation...

167
00:10:13,009 --> 00:10:14,678
When it comes to English,

168
00:10:14,761 --> 00:10:18,807
you can teach 10 times better than
those drunken college pricks.

169
00:10:20,558 --> 00:10:22,894
- I guess so.
- Sure!

170
00:10:23,436 --> 00:10:26,982
But will they hire me?
I'm not a college student.

171
00:10:27,232 --> 00:10:28,692
Just fake it.

172
00:10:28,858 --> 00:10:32,612
Don't worry, you'll have
my recommendation, plus...

173
00:10:33,530 --> 00:10:36,324
How should I describe the mother...?

174
00:10:38,576 --> 00:10:39,995
She's a bit simple.

175
00:10:40,245 --> 00:10:41,329
<i>Young and simple.</i>

176
00:10:41,454 --> 00:10:42,247
Simple?

177
00:10:43,081 --> 00:10:44,416
What do you mean?

178
00:10:44,666 --> 00:10:48,545
Anyway, it's all good.
I had fun there.

179
00:10:49,296 --> 00:10:50,422
So you agree?

180
00:10:50,547 --> 00:10:52,007
I guess so.

181
00:10:53,383 --> 00:10:57,137
Hey, you said your sister
is artistic?

182
00:10:57,387 --> 00:10:58,430
Good at Photoshop?

183
00:11:01,683 --> 00:11:05,770
God, with skills like this,
why can't you get into art school?

184
00:11:05,895 --> 00:11:07,147
Shut up.

185
00:11:09,691 --> 00:11:11,860
Hey, no smoking in here.

186
00:11:11,901 --> 00:11:13,361
Yeah, yeah.
Gimme that.

187
00:11:13,403 --> 00:11:14,279
Yeah.

188
00:11:18,908 --> 00:11:21,578
Now the cherry on top...

189
00:11:23,121 --> 00:11:27,667
Wow, does Oxford have a major
in document forgery?

190
00:11:27,917 --> 00:11:31,171
Ki-jung would be top of her class.

191
00:11:31,421 --> 00:11:34,090
She's amazing, huh?

192
00:11:34,215 --> 00:11:39,387
Our boy's going for a job interview.
Wish him luck.

193
00:11:40,138 --> 00:11:40,889
Son.

194
00:11:42,307 --> 00:11:44,893
I'm proud of you.

195
00:11:45,352 --> 00:11:46,269
Dad.

196
00:11:47,354 --> 00:11:50,315
I don't think of this
as forgery or crime.

197
00:11:50,732 --> 00:11:52,692
I'll go to this university
next year.

198
00:11:52,817 --> 00:11:56,196
So you've got a plan!

199
00:11:56,363 --> 00:12:00,200
I just printed out
the document a bit early.

200
00:12:35,693 --> 00:12:36,653
<i>Who is it?</i>

201
00:12:37,404 --> 00:12:39,364
Madame?
Good afternoon.

202
00:12:39,489 --> 00:12:41,324
I'm here on
Min's recommendation...

203
00:12:41,366 --> 00:12:43,159
<i>Oh right, come in.</i>

204
00:12:44,411 --> 00:12:45,161
Thank you.

205
00:13:17,318 --> 00:13:18,486
Hello!

206
00:13:19,529 --> 00:13:20,697
Hello, Madame.

207
00:13:21,030 --> 00:13:24,159
I just work here.
Come this way.

208
00:13:24,951 --> 00:13:26,578
The yard is so nice.

209
00:13:26,744 --> 00:13:27,996
The inside's nice too.

210
00:13:28,705 --> 00:13:31,916
You know the architect Namgoong?
He's famous.

211
00:13:32,250 --> 00:13:34,669
He used to live in this house.

212
00:13:37,130 --> 00:13:39,007
He designed it himself.

213
00:13:42,135 --> 00:13:47,015
As you can see,
now it's a playpen.

214
00:13:47,557 --> 00:13:48,516
This way.

215
00:13:51,144 --> 00:13:53,521
Sit yourself down here.
I'll bring the madame.

216
00:13:53,646 --> 00:13:54,439
Yes.

217
00:14:06,951 --> 00:14:08,119
<i>Madame.</i>

218
00:14:09,162 --> 00:14:10,330
<i>Madame?</i>

219
00:14:13,082 --> 00:14:14,250
Madame?

220
00:14:16,169 --> 00:14:17,337
Madame?

221
00:14:21,174 --> 00:14:23,343
He's here.
The tutoring candidate.

222
00:14:27,096 --> 00:14:29,057
I don't care about documents.

223
00:14:29,807 --> 00:14:32,352
Min recommended you,
after all.

224
00:14:33,186 --> 00:14:38,942
As you know, Min is such
a <i>brilliant</i> human being.

225
00:14:39,817 --> 00:14:41,986
Da-hye and I were
quite happy with him.

226
00:14:42,111 --> 00:14:45,156
Regardless of her grades.
Know what I mean?

227
00:14:45,490 --> 00:14:46,241
Yes.

228
00:14:46,908 --> 00:14:48,743
He was marvelous.

229
00:14:48,826 --> 00:14:55,750
So to be honest, we wanted to stick
with him through high school.

230
00:14:56,417 --> 00:14:59,587
But all of a sudden
he's going abroad.

231
00:15:02,131 --> 00:15:07,387
Anyway, excuse me,
but if I can speak directly,

232
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:12,517
if you're not up to
Min's level, then,

233
00:15:12,642 --> 00:15:14,686
I'm not sure what the point is.

234
00:15:16,854 --> 00:15:20,608
So anyway,
what I want to say is,

235
00:15:20,942 --> 00:15:26,406
for your first lesson today,
do you mind if I sit in?

236
00:15:26,656 --> 00:15:30,326
I want to see it <i>full time,</i>
how you run your lesson.

237
00:15:32,453 --> 00:15:34,414
<i>Is it okay with you?</i>

238
00:16:02,900 --> 00:16:04,360
You sure about #24?

239
00:16:12,410 --> 00:16:17,248
Da-hye, you solved those later
problems then went back to #24.

240
00:16:17,498 --> 00:16:18,833
Right?

241
00:16:20,501 --> 00:16:21,669
Yes.

242
00:16:29,636 --> 00:16:34,766
If that were the first question
on a real exam, you'd be screwed.

243
00:16:35,516 --> 00:16:38,978
Look at this.
Your pulse is racing.

244
00:16:41,648 --> 00:16:44,901
The heart doesn't lie.

245
00:16:45,943 --> 00:16:49,280
An exam is like
slashing through a jungle.

246
00:16:49,447 --> 00:16:51,991
Lose that momentum
and you're finished.

247
00:16:52,450 --> 00:16:54,702
The answer to #24?
I don't care.

248
00:16:54,952 --> 00:16:59,999
Slashing through the exam,
dominating it!

249
00:17:00,750 --> 00:17:02,418
That's all I care about.

250
00:17:03,670 --> 00:17:07,131
What you need is vigor.

251
00:17:08,549 --> 00:17:09,634
Vigor.

252
00:17:11,052 --> 00:17:12,136
Understand?

253
00:17:23,481 --> 00:17:26,234
So I'll pay you
this time each month.

254
00:17:26,359 --> 00:17:29,237
3 classes a week,
2 hours each, okay?

255
00:17:30,363 --> 00:17:31,406
As for the fee,

256
00:17:31,489 --> 00:17:35,159
I was going to pay Min's rate,
then I added a bit for inflation.

257
00:17:35,368 --> 00:17:36,536
Thank you.

258
00:17:38,454 --> 00:17:40,248
How about a
proper introduction?

259
00:17:40,498 --> 00:17:43,126
Da-hye's tutor,
we'll call him Kevin.

260
00:17:44,085 --> 00:17:45,461
Mr. Kevin!

261
00:17:46,170 --> 00:17:49,424
If you feel like snacking during
your lesson, just call me.

262
00:17:49,799 --> 00:17:51,759
If you need anything, ask her.

263
00:17:52,009 --> 00:17:54,262
She knows this house
better than I...

264
00:17:54,595 --> 00:17:57,849
Da-song, stop it!

265
00:17:58,391 --> 00:18:00,059
I'm sorry, did he startle you?

266
00:18:00,101 --> 00:18:02,478
How cute.
His name's Da-song?

267
00:18:02,603 --> 00:18:04,272
Yes, our youngest.

268
00:18:04,522 --> 00:18:05,982
Da-song, come say hi!

269
00:18:06,190 --> 00:18:07,567
This is Mr. Kevin!

270
00:18:10,111 --> 00:18:14,490
This is an Indian arrow.
I ordered it from the U.S.

271
00:18:14,615 --> 00:18:17,577
From last year he's been
an Indian fanatic.

272
00:18:19,620 --> 00:18:20,580
Indians?

273
00:18:21,622 --> 00:18:24,167
He's got a fanboy personality?

274
00:18:24,417 --> 00:18:28,087
Well, he's eccentric
and easily distracted,

275
00:18:28,129 --> 00:18:30,590
he can barely sit still!

276
00:18:31,048 --> 00:18:33,217
So last year I enrolled him
in Cub Scouts,

277
00:18:33,342 --> 00:18:36,220
hoping he'd learn
moderation and focus.

278
00:18:36,345 --> 00:18:37,513
But look.

279
00:18:38,556 --> 00:18:39,724
He's even worse.

280
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:47,398
His scout leader is an
Indian fanatic, maybe that's why.

281
00:18:48,149 --> 00:18:52,487
The American Indian is
the very spirit of the Cub Scouts.

282
00:18:52,570 --> 00:18:53,488
It's a good thing.

283
00:18:53,654 --> 00:18:56,616
Were you a Cub Scout, Kevin?

284
00:18:56,866 --> 00:19:00,036
Sure, I'm a Scout by nature.

285
00:19:00,161 --> 00:19:04,207
Da-song is an artist by nature.
Look at this painting.

286
00:19:04,874 --> 00:19:08,127
It's so metaphorical.
It's really strong.

287
00:19:08,461 --> 00:19:09,754
Strong, right?

288
00:19:10,171 --> 00:19:12,131
You've got an eye for this.

289
00:19:13,591 --> 00:19:15,009
It's a chimpanzee, right?

290
00:19:15,176 --> 00:19:16,636
A self-portrait.

291
00:19:19,889 --> 00:19:21,432
Sure enough!

292
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:25,937
The perspective of a young artist
eludes understanding.

293
00:19:26,187 --> 00:19:28,356
Or perhaps it's Da-song's
expressive genius...

294
00:19:28,689 --> 00:19:33,945
Anyway, we've been through
so many art teachers.

295
00:19:34,278 --> 00:19:36,155
None of them lasts
even a month.

296
00:19:37,323 --> 00:19:40,785
And Da-song is just
so hard to control.

297
00:19:43,704 --> 00:19:45,790
- Just a moment, Madame.
- Yes?

298
00:19:46,415 --> 00:19:49,752
Someone just came to mind.

299
00:19:50,336 --> 00:19:51,796
What was her name?

300
00:19:52,338 --> 00:19:54,799
Jessica!
Right, Jessica...

301
00:19:55,216 --> 00:19:59,178
She was in the same
art school as my cousin.

302
00:19:59,637 --> 00:20:02,098
What was her Korean name?

303
00:20:02,348 --> 00:20:07,311
Anyway, after studying applied arts
at Illinois State University,

304
00:20:07,436 --> 00:20:09,105
she returned to Korea.

305
00:20:09,438 --> 00:20:11,607
Illinois... tell me more.

306
00:20:12,024 --> 00:20:18,072
Her teaching is unusual, but she
knows how to handle kids.

307
00:20:18,823 --> 00:20:21,409
She's got a special
reputation in her field.

308
00:20:21,951 --> 00:20:24,495
But even though her methods
are unique,

309
00:20:24,620 --> 00:20:26,914
she can help kids
get into good art schools.

310
00:20:26,956 --> 00:20:30,793
Now I'm really curious.
What is she like?

311
00:20:31,460 --> 00:20:32,920
Would you like to meet her?

312
00:20:33,379 --> 00:20:36,340
Though I heard
she's in high demand...

313
00:20:42,555 --> 00:20:43,431
Hold on.

314
00:20:45,391 --> 00:20:48,853
Jessica, only child,
Illinois Chicago,

315
00:20:48,978 --> 00:20:51,856
classmate Kim Jin-mo,
he's your cousin.

316
00:20:58,988 --> 00:21:03,034
Look at how he painted
the side dishes on the tablecloth

317
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:05,369
in this mosaic arrangement.

318
00:21:05,703 --> 00:21:08,456
But within that too,
there are repeating <i>patterns.</i>

319
00:21:08,497 --> 00:21:11,834
<i>Gochujang is red,</i>
the rice... well, <i>anyway,</i>

320
00:21:11,876 --> 00:21:16,547
he has a Basquiat-esque sense,
even at age 9!

321
00:21:17,214 --> 00:21:18,674
How exciting.

322
00:21:19,091 --> 00:21:23,888
I'm sure Miss Jessica must have
already sensed this,

323
00:21:24,305 --> 00:21:28,059
so I'll leave you two,
and go up for Da-hye's lesson.

324
00:21:29,018 --> 00:21:30,561
Have a nice lesson, Jessica.

325
00:21:30,728 --> 00:21:32,355
Yes, thank you
for the introduction.

326
00:21:36,525 --> 00:21:41,906
So as you can see,
Da-song's eccentric genius...

327
00:21:44,742 --> 00:21:45,409
Da-hye.

328
00:21:46,202 --> 00:21:49,288
So we'll start with #38?

329
00:21:53,834 --> 00:21:55,002
Kevin.

330
00:21:55,252 --> 00:21:56,170
Yeah?

331
00:21:56,629 --> 00:22:01,509
Did you know that
Da-song is faking it all?

332
00:22:01,968 --> 00:22:04,512
Huh? What do you mean?

333
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:06,305
It's all a show.

334
00:22:06,472 --> 00:22:10,226
Acting like a genius, that
4th dimension stuff is all fake.

335
00:22:10,351 --> 00:22:11,602
An artist cosplay.

336
00:22:12,228 --> 00:22:13,437
Da-song?

337
00:22:15,064 --> 00:22:16,440
You know that thing,

338
00:22:16,649 --> 00:22:20,695
when he freezes and stares at
the sky, as if struck by inspiration.

339
00:22:21,487 --> 00:22:26,951
So he's walking along, then he
stares at the clouds for 10 minutes.

340
00:22:27,576 --> 00:22:29,203
So you know what I mean?

341
00:22:29,578 --> 00:22:32,123
He gives me the creeps.

342
00:22:32,289 --> 00:22:35,334
He pretends that he
can't live a normal life.

343
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:37,420
Makes me want to puke.

344
00:22:37,670 --> 00:22:40,464
So Da-song is pretending...

345
00:22:41,382 --> 00:22:45,261
But what's that got to do with
your studies?

346
00:22:49,306 --> 00:22:52,977
Well, I'm just saying.

347
00:22:55,604 --> 00:22:57,481
Sure, so in that sense,

348
00:22:58,899 --> 00:23:02,862
what you told me about Da-song
was very interesting,

349
00:23:03,404 --> 00:23:05,281
so let's write about it in English.

350
00:23:05,698 --> 00:23:11,495
And be sure to use the word
'pretend' at least twice.

351
00:23:12,288 --> 00:23:15,082
Then, can I ask you a question?

352
00:23:15,416 --> 00:23:16,083
Sure.

353
00:23:16,542 --> 00:23:18,669
That teacher Jessica.

354
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:26,302
Is she really
your cousin's classmate?

355
00:23:28,137 --> 00:23:29,597
What do you mean?

356
00:23:29,847 --> 00:23:31,891
She's your girlfriend, right?

357
00:23:35,061 --> 00:23:39,023
No way...
I just met her today.

358
00:23:43,152 --> 00:23:46,113
Jessica's really pretty,
isn't she?

359
00:23:46,947 --> 00:23:48,824
Aren't you interested?

360
00:23:50,076 --> 00:23:51,619
You saw her?

361
00:23:51,869 --> 00:23:56,040
Sure, she's pretty.
She's a beautiful woman.

362
00:23:56,373 --> 00:23:57,124
Yeah.

363
00:23:59,668 --> 00:24:02,546
I knew it.

364
00:24:03,380 --> 00:24:05,341
So you are interested.

365
00:24:08,177 --> 00:24:09,553
Da-hye...

366
00:24:11,972 --> 00:24:18,646
So, if we can compare
Jessica to a rose,

367
00:24:18,854 --> 00:24:20,064
then you are...

368
00:25:06,402 --> 00:25:07,903
- Let's study.
- Yes.

369
00:25:07,945 --> 00:25:13,284
Please understand that my boy
has trouble keeping still.

370
00:25:13,409 --> 00:25:14,577
I understand.

371
00:25:15,161 --> 00:25:16,203
Da-song!

372
00:25:17,663 --> 00:25:18,372
Da-song, get up!

373
00:25:18,414 --> 00:25:19,790
Come on, Da-song!

374
00:25:20,416 --> 00:25:21,876
In your butt...

375
00:25:22,126 --> 00:25:24,712
- Madame, please leave us.
- What?

376
00:25:25,129 --> 00:25:27,590
I never teach with
a parent in the room.

377
00:25:27,965 --> 00:25:30,384
But today is our first day,
and as you can see, he's...

378
00:25:30,426 --> 00:25:32,136
Wait downstairs.

379
00:25:33,679 --> 00:25:34,805
Park Da-song?

380
00:25:35,055 --> 00:25:35,931
Da-song!

381
00:25:40,269 --> 00:25:41,395
Madame?

382
00:25:42,563 --> 00:25:43,939
Want some plum extract?

383
00:25:44,190 --> 00:25:44,815
What?

384
00:25:45,274 --> 00:25:48,319
It's mixed with honey.
To ease your tension.

385
00:25:48,694 --> 00:25:50,738
Yeah, that would be great.

386
00:26:05,586 --> 00:26:07,046
- Hey.
- Yes?

387
00:26:07,796 --> 00:26:09,048
I've got an idea.

388
00:26:09,173 --> 00:26:12,051
Take two glasses of plum extract
to Da-song's room.

389
00:26:12,593 --> 00:26:15,679
You're not a parent,
so you can go in!

390
00:26:15,804 --> 00:26:17,056
Oh, that's right!

391
00:26:17,306 --> 00:26:20,142
Then I'll report back
on what's going on in there...

392
00:26:20,309 --> 00:26:22,686
Why didn't I think of it earlier?

393
00:26:25,314 --> 00:26:25,940
What?

394
00:26:26,732 --> 00:26:27,775
They came out?

395
00:26:28,484 --> 00:26:29,360
Yeah.

396
00:26:31,820 --> 00:26:34,657
So you're done already?

397
00:26:36,325 --> 00:26:37,493
Madame.

398
00:26:38,118 --> 00:26:39,995
Come sit next to me.

399
00:26:42,122 --> 00:26:43,666
Da-song, go upstairs.

400
00:26:46,043 --> 00:26:46,710
Hurry up!

401
00:26:53,759 --> 00:26:55,469
Da-song just painted this.

402
00:26:55,761 --> 00:26:56,804
I see...

403
00:26:58,639 --> 00:27:01,016
I'd rather speak with
Madame alone.

404
00:27:01,267 --> 00:27:02,518
Oh, but she is...

405
00:27:02,559 --> 00:27:05,187
No, leave us.

406
00:27:09,566 --> 00:27:15,739
Madame, I told you I study
art psychology and art therapy?

407
00:27:15,864 --> 00:27:16,740
Yes.

408
00:27:17,866 --> 00:27:20,244
Did anything happen to Da-song
in first grade?

409
00:27:22,955 --> 00:27:25,249
To be frank,

410
00:27:25,791 --> 00:27:29,044
before I decide whether
to take on Da-song,

411
00:27:29,253 --> 00:27:31,630
I need to hear about this.

412
00:27:32,089 --> 00:27:35,843
But this is hard for me
to talk about right now.

413
00:27:36,260 --> 00:27:37,136
What to do?

414
00:27:37,177 --> 00:27:38,512
Never mind, then.

415
00:27:39,096 --> 00:27:44,059
The lower-right region of a painting
is called the 'schizophrenia zone'.

416
00:27:44,393 --> 00:27:46,937
Psychotic symptoms often
reveal themselves here.

417
00:27:46,979 --> 00:27:47,938
Oh, phrenia...

418
00:27:47,980 --> 00:27:48,856
Look here.

419
00:27:49,106 --> 00:27:51,442
Da-song painted this
unusual shape, right?

420
00:27:51,775 --> 00:27:52,651
I see.

421
00:27:54,695 --> 00:27:57,865
Over there, it's the same!
It's the same, right?

422
00:27:57,990 --> 00:27:59,783
Yes, that's correct.

423
00:28:00,284 --> 00:28:03,787
A similar shape in the same zone.
You see it now?

424
00:28:04,079 --> 00:28:04,955
Yes.

425
00:28:05,706 --> 00:28:10,044
I've stared at that painting
at every meal!

426
00:28:10,294 --> 00:28:12,171
But I had no idea.

427
00:28:12,504 --> 00:28:15,299
Calm down.
Let's compose ourselves.

428
00:28:16,133 --> 00:28:18,886
This is all a black box
into Da-song's mind.

429
00:28:19,595 --> 00:28:23,182
Would you like to open
that box with me, Madame?

430
00:28:24,224 --> 00:28:25,684
I want to open it.

431
00:28:25,851 --> 00:28:30,189
Then we'll need 4
two-hour sessions per week,

432
00:28:30,356 --> 00:28:34,693
and this is not simple tutoring,
it's art therapy, right?

433
00:28:34,735 --> 00:28:35,402
Of course.

434
00:28:35,652 --> 00:28:39,198
Because of that my rate is set
at a very high level.

435
00:28:40,324 --> 00:28:41,116
Are you okay with that?

436
00:28:41,241 --> 00:28:42,618
It's my pleasure.

437
00:28:44,161 --> 00:28:45,829
Da-song's dad is home.

438
00:28:52,544 --> 00:28:56,590
Honey, Da-song's new
art teacher is here.

439
00:28:59,343 --> 00:29:01,428
Her name's Jessica,
from Illinois.

440
00:29:02,054 --> 00:29:03,931
<i>Jessica! This is Dong-ik.</i>

441
00:29:04,473 --> 00:29:06,016
- Hello.
- Hi.

442
00:29:06,350 --> 00:29:07,851
Thanks for your help.

443
00:29:08,394 --> 00:29:09,311
Class is over?

444
00:29:09,395 --> 00:29:10,354
Yes, just finished.

445
00:29:10,979 --> 00:29:12,231
- Driver Yoon.
- Yes?

446
00:29:12,356 --> 00:29:13,857
- Are you free?
- Yes, I am.

447
00:29:13,982 --> 00:29:16,318
Then give her a lift, okay?

448
00:29:16,693 --> 00:29:21,156
Sure, we don't want her
going down alone at night, right?

449
00:29:21,198 --> 00:29:22,157
Of course.

450
00:29:22,658 --> 00:29:23,659
Miss Jessica?

451
00:29:24,410 --> 00:29:29,748
Shall I drive you
all the way home, then?

452
00:29:31,083 --> 00:29:33,544
- Which neighborhood?
- No, that's fine.

453
00:29:33,585 --> 00:29:37,047
You can just drop me off
at Hyehwa station.

454
00:29:37,714 --> 00:29:38,549
Thank you.

455
00:29:38,590 --> 00:29:39,967
I don't mind if it's far away.

456
00:29:40,008 --> 00:29:43,971
- My shift is finished, anyway.
- I'll get off at Hyehwa.

457
00:29:44,304 --> 00:29:47,391
Looks like it's going to rain.

458
00:29:49,226 --> 00:29:51,562
Ride the Benz, not the subway!

459
00:29:51,603 --> 00:29:54,690
I'm meeting my boyfriend
at exit 3 of Hyehwa Station!

460
00:29:56,442 --> 00:29:57,276
Yes.

461
00:30:32,227 --> 00:30:36,106
Dad, when you worked as a driver,
did you drive a lot of Benzes?

462
00:30:36,857 --> 00:30:43,030
Benzes? Not then, but I did
when I worked as a valet.

463
00:30:43,780 --> 00:30:46,325
You worked as a valet?

464
00:30:46,492 --> 00:30:50,204
Sure, after the chicken place went bust,
before the Taiwan cake shop,

465
00:30:50,287 --> 00:30:52,122
in that 6-month window?

466
00:30:52,247 --> 00:30:55,709
No, it was after
the cake shop went bust.

467
00:30:58,670 --> 00:31:00,464
We're moving to
the next stage already?

468
00:31:01,298 --> 00:31:04,968
I set a trap in the Benz.

469
00:31:05,093 --> 00:31:06,637
Then we're diving right in.

470
00:31:07,179 --> 00:31:09,056
Wow, this is so metaphorical.

471
00:31:09,515 --> 00:31:12,976
Look Dad, we're eating in a
driver's cafeteria right now!

472
00:31:13,685 --> 00:31:15,354
Right, a driver's cafeteria!

473
00:31:15,979 --> 00:31:17,981
Eat as much as you want, kids.

474
00:31:18,190 --> 00:31:20,776
You didn't even pay for it,
they did!

475
00:31:21,109 --> 00:31:23,987
Son, have some more.
Eat up!

476
00:31:24,321 --> 00:31:25,072
Yes, Dad.

477
00:31:25,280 --> 00:31:26,281
Eat your fill!

478
00:31:26,406 --> 00:31:28,575
What did you do
to that woman yesterday?

479
00:31:28,700 --> 00:31:29,284
What?

480
00:31:29,493 --> 00:31:30,994
She was freaking out.

481
00:31:31,286 --> 00:31:33,288
Saying she was so moved,
you put her in shock.

482
00:31:33,705 --> 00:31:34,957
Fuck, I don't know!

483
00:31:35,207 --> 00:31:38,794
I googled 'art therapy',
and ad-libbed the rest.

484
00:31:39,211 --> 00:31:41,463
Then suddenly she's weeping.

485
00:31:41,838 --> 00:31:43,882
Crazy bitch,
I couldn't believe it.

486
00:32:17,457 --> 00:32:19,835
Oh, you're home?

487
00:32:19,960 --> 00:32:21,336
Did you eat yet?

488
00:32:23,463 --> 00:32:25,048
Is something wrong?

489
00:32:25,090 --> 00:32:26,341
Is the housekeeper out?

490
00:32:26,466 --> 00:32:28,218
She's walking the dogs.

491
00:32:29,094 --> 00:32:30,220
Honey.

492
00:32:31,388 --> 00:32:33,432
This was under my car seat.

493
00:32:36,059 --> 00:32:38,228
Driver Yoon is such a scumbag.

494
00:32:38,270 --> 00:32:39,646
What is this?

495
00:32:40,689 --> 00:32:42,065
I'm sorry, honey.

496
00:32:42,399 --> 00:32:44,234
I didn't know he was
this kind of guy.

497
00:32:44,610 --> 00:32:47,362
Don't you pay him well?

498
00:32:47,988 --> 00:32:50,866
Is he saving up by
not paying for a motel?

499
00:32:51,283 --> 00:32:52,451
He must be a pervert.

500
00:32:52,868 --> 00:32:54,077
He likes it in the car.

501
00:32:54,202 --> 00:32:58,040
Oh, that's gross.
In his boss' car!

502
00:32:58,206 --> 00:33:02,544
A young guy's sex life is
his own business, that's all fine.

503
00:33:06,298 --> 00:33:08,592
But why in my car?

504
00:33:10,135 --> 00:33:13,972
And if so, why not in his seat?
Why cross the line like that?

505
00:33:14,097 --> 00:33:15,265
You're right.

506
00:33:15,891 --> 00:33:18,894
Does dripping his sperm
on my seat turn him on?

507
00:33:19,144 --> 00:33:20,979
I can't believe this.

508
00:33:25,734 --> 00:33:29,696
But you know what's
strangest of all?

509
00:33:30,739 --> 00:33:31,615
What?

510
00:33:32,949 --> 00:33:35,202
Usually if you have car sex,

511
00:33:35,410 --> 00:33:40,374
you might leave behind
a strand of hair, or an earring.

512
00:33:40,749 --> 00:33:41,708
Right.

513
00:33:41,958 --> 00:33:45,504
But how can you forget
your own panties?

514
00:33:46,046 --> 00:33:49,925
That's right.
It's hard to overlook.

515
00:33:51,176 --> 00:33:55,222
So it makes me quite suspicious
of this woman's condition.

516
00:33:56,348 --> 00:33:57,432
You get me?

517
00:34:07,359 --> 00:34:09,027
<i>Oh my</i>...meth or cocaine?

518
00:34:09,069 --> 00:34:10,445
Shh! The kids...

519
00:34:11,196 --> 00:34:12,447
What do we do?

520
00:34:12,572 --> 00:34:15,325
What if anyone finds
white powder in your car?

521
00:34:15,367 --> 00:34:17,619
Calm down, <i>relax.</i>

522
00:34:18,495 --> 00:34:19,663
<i>Relax.</i>

523
00:34:20,288 --> 00:34:23,458
For now it's just supposition.
A rational guess.

524
00:34:24,209 --> 00:34:26,044
But no need to call the police.

525
00:34:26,086 --> 00:34:27,629
Not that!

526
00:34:28,505 --> 00:34:34,261
Still, for a busy man like me to ask,
"Why are you fucking in my car?"

527
00:34:34,386 --> 00:34:35,470
Exactly.

528
00:34:35,595 --> 00:34:37,347
So instead...

529
00:34:37,514 --> 00:34:42,352
Can you just invent some
bland excuse to let him go?

530
00:34:42,686 --> 00:34:43,979
Okay sure.

531
00:34:44,104 --> 00:34:47,190
No need to mention
panties or car sex.

532
00:34:47,607 --> 00:34:49,651
We don't need to stoop
to that level, do we?

533
00:34:49,693 --> 00:34:51,361
Surely not!

534
00:34:51,987 --> 00:34:55,157
But what if he goes online
and accuses us...

535
00:34:55,198 --> 00:34:56,867
Just give him a good severance.

536
00:34:57,701 --> 00:35:00,871
How was Da-song today?

537
00:35:01,121 --> 00:35:02,873
He was fine.

538
00:35:03,623 --> 00:35:05,792
- So class is finished?
- Yes.

539
00:35:05,917 --> 00:35:08,587
Jessica, the last time you came,

540
00:35:08,628 --> 00:35:11,006
our driver gave you a ride, right?

541
00:35:11,131 --> 00:35:12,090
That's right.

542
00:35:12,132 --> 00:35:14,217
This may be an odd question,

543
00:35:14,551 --> 00:35:16,094
but nothing happened then?

544
00:35:16,553 --> 00:35:18,013
No, he was very nice.

545
00:35:18,054 --> 00:35:19,973
I told him to go
to Hyehwa Station,

546
00:35:20,015 --> 00:35:23,226
but he insisted on
driving me home.

547
00:35:23,351 --> 00:35:26,480
That jerk!
He took you home late at night?

548
00:35:26,646 --> 00:35:27,981
Revealing where you live?

549
00:35:29,065 --> 00:35:31,526
No, I got off at Hyehwa.

550
00:35:31,735 --> 00:35:33,737
Oh, good girl. Very good.

551
00:35:34,154 --> 00:35:35,405
<i>Jessica nice...</i>

552
00:35:35,781 --> 00:35:37,908
Did something happen with him?

553
00:35:38,283 --> 00:35:43,330
He won't be working for us any more.
A slightly shameful incident.

554
00:35:43,580 --> 00:35:45,499
What incident?

555
00:35:45,665 --> 00:35:48,251
Oh, you don't need to know.

556
00:35:49,878 --> 00:35:53,757
But I'm surprised.
He was so gentlemanly and cool.

557
00:35:53,882 --> 00:35:57,135
Jessica, you're too
young and innocent!

558
00:35:57,302 --> 00:35:59,054
You have a lot to learn about people.

559
00:36:00,096 --> 00:36:04,935
But we were excited to have
such a young, hip driver, too.

560
00:36:05,101 --> 00:36:08,271
But isn't an older driver better?

561
00:36:08,396 --> 00:36:12,150
That's true. They drive better,
have better manners.

562
00:36:12,484 --> 00:36:15,070
My father's brother had
a driver just like that.

563
00:36:15,195 --> 00:36:19,658
Mr. Kim.
He was so congenial and nice,

564
00:36:19,783 --> 00:36:22,369
I used to call him Uncle
when I was young.

565
00:36:22,410 --> 00:36:24,371
You know a man like that?

566
00:36:24,496 --> 00:36:27,165
Yes, he was so mild-mannered.

567
00:36:28,083 --> 00:36:32,462
Oh, but my relatives
relocated to Chicago.

568
00:36:33,922 --> 00:36:35,882
I wonder if
Mr. Kim's free now?

569
00:36:36,216 --> 00:36:40,178
I'm really interested!
Could I meet him?

570
00:36:40,303 --> 00:36:41,388
Really?

571
00:36:41,429 --> 00:36:43,473
I don't trust anyone now.

572
00:36:44,307 --> 00:36:47,185
I only trust someone recommended
by a person I know well.

573
00:36:47,352 --> 00:36:51,690
But if you've known him so long,
I'd feel much more at ease.

574
00:36:54,651 --> 00:36:56,319
Do you really want to meet him?

575
00:36:57,153 --> 00:36:58,405
<i>I'm deadly serious.</i>

576
00:36:59,114 --> 00:37:02,492
This chain of
recommendations is best.

577
00:37:03,034 --> 00:37:04,202
How should I describe it?

578
00:37:04,744 --> 00:37:05,829
A belt of trust?

579
00:37:06,454 --> 00:37:07,706
- This one's different.
- Here.

580
00:37:07,747 --> 00:37:08,415
Oh, right.

581
00:37:08,456 --> 00:37:09,708
And this one.

582
00:37:10,166 --> 00:37:11,793
Looks like a touch screen now.

583
00:37:11,835 --> 00:37:14,796
It's not touch,
it says you have to turn it.

584
00:37:14,838 --> 00:37:16,506
Wow, this thing?

585
00:37:17,257 --> 00:37:18,091
Sir?

586
00:37:18,383 --> 00:37:20,427
Taking our time, are we?

587
00:37:23,638 --> 00:37:24,806
This is a nice car.

588
00:37:27,392 --> 00:37:29,352
This is it! Come over here.

589
00:37:33,064 --> 00:37:34,232
He's in a meeting now.

590
00:37:39,487 --> 00:37:41,323
Have a seat and wait here.

591
00:37:50,290 --> 00:37:53,376
Hello, nice to meet...

592
00:37:56,880 --> 00:37:58,340
But is it compatible
with a phone?

593
00:37:58,423 --> 00:38:04,763
Oh, not with a phone.
You need more computing power.

594
00:38:06,222 --> 00:38:10,560
This isn't any sort of test,
so don't be nervous.

595
00:38:11,436 --> 00:38:14,356
I was worn out at the office,
so I came out for a bit.

596
00:38:15,190 --> 00:38:16,191
I understand.

597
00:38:16,441 --> 00:38:20,695
Constant chatter, all that bother.
At least the car is peaceful.

598
00:38:23,448 --> 00:38:24,407
Thank you.

599
00:38:25,533 --> 00:38:26,910
You seem to know
the roads well?

600
00:38:27,118 --> 00:38:30,163
Anything below the 38th parallel.

601
00:38:30,538 --> 00:38:33,416
After 30 years behind the wheel,
the car almost drives itself.

602
00:38:34,042 --> 00:38:36,586
I respect those who work
in one field for a long time.

603
00:38:37,212 --> 00:38:39,923
Well, to be honest,
this is a simple vocation.

604
00:38:39,965 --> 00:38:42,926
But... the head of a household,

605
00:38:43,551 --> 00:38:45,011
the leader of a company?

606
00:38:45,470 --> 00:38:50,225
Or else just a lonely man setting off
on the road each morning...

607
00:38:51,059 --> 00:38:52,894
It's companionship of a sort,

608
00:38:53,353 --> 00:38:56,106
so that's how
I've approached each day.

609
00:38:56,356 --> 00:38:58,400
The years sure pass quickly.

610
00:39:01,987 --> 00:39:04,239
Sure enough,
your cornering is excellent.

611
00:39:05,281 --> 00:39:11,329
Well, it may look simple,
but it's one of the fundamentals.

612
00:39:11,788 --> 00:39:16,209
<i>She may look like a sheep,
but inside, she's a fox.</i>

613
00:39:16,668 --> 00:39:19,421
<i>Sometimes she acts like
she owns the house.</i>

614
00:39:20,296 --> 00:39:21,047
<i>Right.</i>

615
00:39:21,381 --> 00:39:25,760
<i>Of all the people in that house,
she's lived there the longest.</i>

616
00:39:25,969 --> 00:39:29,556
<i>She was housekeeper
to the architect Namgoong,</i>

617
00:39:29,681 --> 00:39:34,060
<i>but then she went on
to work for this family.</i>

618
00:39:34,602 --> 00:39:36,271
<i>When the architect moved out,</i>

619
00:39:36,396 --> 00:39:39,274
<i>he introduced this woman
to Park's family,</i>

620
00:39:39,399 --> 00:39:42,360
<i>telling them, "This is a great
housekeeper, you should hire her."</i>

621
00:39:42,610 --> 00:39:45,989
<i>So she survived
a change of ownership.</i>

622
00:39:46,281 --> 00:39:48,992
She won't give up a good job easily.

623
00:39:49,534 --> 00:39:52,662
To extract a woman like that,
we need to prepare well.

624
00:39:54,330 --> 00:39:56,666
Right, we need a plan.

625
00:39:58,043 --> 00:40:01,296
I want to eat peaches.
I like peaches best.

626
00:40:01,838 --> 00:40:03,089
Why not ask for some?

627
00:40:03,339 --> 00:40:06,801
No peaches at our house.
It's forbidden fruit.

628
00:40:14,809 --> 00:40:17,687
<i>So according to what
Da-hye told me,</i>

629
00:40:17,729 --> 00:40:22,025
<i>she's got a massively serious
allergy to peaches.</i>

630
00:40:22,442 --> 00:40:25,528
<i>You know that fuzz
on a peach's skin?</i>

631
00:40:25,820 --> 00:40:29,491
<i>If she's anywhere near it,
she gets a full body rash,</i>

632
00:40:29,532 --> 00:40:33,119
<i>has trouble breathing,
asthma, a total meltdown!</i>

633
00:40:37,749 --> 00:40:41,836
No no, there weren't
any peaches anywhere.

634
00:40:43,838 --> 00:40:45,924
That's what I'm saying!

635
00:40:46,466 --> 00:40:48,843
Usually when I get
symptoms like this,

636
00:40:49,094 --> 00:40:52,222
I run to my room
and take my medicine,

637
00:40:52,597 --> 00:40:57,852
but it was so sudden,
I wasn't sure where I left it.

638
00:40:58,103 --> 00:41:02,816
Madame, this woman
behind me, is that...?

639
00:41:03,191 --> 00:41:05,068
Oh, it's our housekeeper!

640
00:41:05,193 --> 00:41:07,570
So it's true.
Oh, how sad.

641
00:41:07,987 --> 00:41:10,740
I wasn't sure if that
was really her.

642
00:41:11,074 --> 00:41:14,452
I've only seen her a couple times
in the living room.

643
00:41:15,286 --> 00:41:17,163
This was in the hospital?

644
00:41:17,413 --> 00:41:21,042
A few days ago I went for
my annual medical exam.

645
00:41:21,709 --> 00:41:25,880
I took a selfie for my wife,
and there she was behind me.

646
00:41:26,422 --> 00:41:28,591
Is she talking
on the phone there?

647
00:41:28,633 --> 00:41:31,845
Anyway. I wasn't trying to eavesdrop...

648
00:41:31,886 --> 00:41:33,471
I wasn't trying to eavesdrop,

649
00:41:33,888 --> 00:41:35,598
but her words came through clearly!

650
00:41:35,807 --> 00:41:37,392
- So I couldn't help but...!
- Cut, cut!

651
00:41:37,642 --> 00:41:40,562
Dad, your emotions are up to here.

652
00:41:40,603 --> 00:41:42,480
Bring them down to about there.

653
00:41:43,148 --> 00:41:45,900
...so I couldn't help but overhear.

654
00:41:45,942 --> 00:41:48,361
Keep it focused!

655
00:41:50,029 --> 00:41:52,574
What I'm trying to say is,
it's just that,

656
00:41:52,615 --> 00:41:56,494
your housekeeper's voice
is quite loud, you know?

657
00:41:56,953 --> 00:42:00,582
I understand, it's all right.
Just tell me, okay?

658
00:42:00,623 --> 00:42:03,501
She said she got diagnosed
with active TB,

659
00:42:03,543 --> 00:42:05,503
and she was shouting
on the phone,

660
00:42:05,670 --> 00:42:08,715
so upset she could
barely control herself!

661
00:42:08,840 --> 00:42:11,217
Tuberculosis? Come on...

662
00:42:11,259 --> 00:42:16,306
It's true, she phoned someone
saying she had active TB.

663
00:42:16,973 --> 00:42:19,017
Do people still get TB?

664
00:42:19,184 --> 00:42:21,436
Do people still get TB?

665
00:42:21,978 --> 00:42:22,645
Dad...

666
00:42:23,062 --> 00:42:28,234
Back in the day, people used
to buy Christmas Seals, right?

667
00:42:28,359 --> 00:42:29,652
Feels like a bygone era.

668
00:42:29,777 --> 00:42:31,321
But I saw it on the internet.

669
00:42:31,571 --> 00:42:35,158
Korea has the #1 rate of TB
of all the OECD countries.

670
00:42:35,491 --> 00:42:38,828
But she's still working,
as if nothing's wrong.

671
00:42:39,078 --> 00:42:41,039
With a kid like Da-song
in the house.

672
00:42:41,164 --> 00:42:44,167
So you've got a young kid
like Da-song in the house,

673
00:42:44,500 --> 00:42:47,629
and a TB patient is doing dishes,
cooking, spraying spittle...

674
00:42:47,879 --> 00:42:49,172
Stop it, please!

675
00:42:53,801 --> 00:42:55,470
<i>Dad: Arriving in 3 mins</i>

676
00:43:42,350 --> 00:43:46,020
If you get the chance,
this'll be icing on the cake.

677
00:44:16,551 --> 00:44:18,261
<i>- Madame -</i>

678
00:44:18,303 --> 00:44:20,138
<i>2nd floor sauna room</i>

679
00:44:20,179 --> 00:44:21,347
<i>Don't let her see you</i>

680
00:44:31,774 --> 00:44:33,026
- Have a seat.
- Yes.

681
00:44:35,486 --> 00:44:36,279
Mr. Kim.

682
00:44:36,612 --> 00:44:40,366
Please don't tell any of this
to my husband, okay?

683
00:44:40,783 --> 00:44:41,659
Understood.

684
00:44:41,909 --> 00:44:46,247
If he hears I brought a
TB patient to our home,

685
00:44:46,706 --> 00:44:49,375
I'll be hanged
and quartered!

686
00:44:49,584 --> 00:44:51,169
Don't worry, Madame.

687
00:44:51,586 --> 00:44:54,881
And if I may presume
to say one thing.

688
00:44:55,298 --> 00:44:58,259
I have no feelings
against that woman.

689
00:44:58,926 --> 00:45:06,184
I felt I had to speak up for the
sake of public health and hygiene.

690
00:45:06,601 --> 00:45:10,104
But this could be seen
as snitching or...

691
00:45:10,229 --> 00:45:11,606
Don't you worry.

692
00:45:11,731 --> 00:45:14,275
I won't mention the TB.

693
00:45:14,359 --> 00:45:16,694
I'll just make up some excuse
to dismiss her.

694
00:45:16,944 --> 00:45:18,112
Simply and quietly.

695
00:45:20,031 --> 00:45:22,617
It's a proven method.
That's the best.

696
00:45:22,867 --> 00:45:24,410
Okay, then.

697
00:45:35,671 --> 00:45:38,633
Have you...
washed your hands?

698
00:46:24,387 --> 00:46:28,558
Mr. Kim, do you know
a good braised ribs place?

699
00:46:28,683 --> 00:46:30,268
Somewhere close by.

700
00:46:30,435 --> 00:46:31,477
Sure.

701
00:46:31,894 --> 00:46:35,273
- Then you'll be eating out?
- That's right.

702
00:46:36,232 --> 00:46:38,860
Why such a craving for
braised ribs today?

703
00:46:39,444 --> 00:46:42,280
Our old housekeeper made
delicious ribs.

704
00:46:43,322 --> 00:46:45,783
The one who quit this week?

705
00:46:45,825 --> 00:46:50,413
My wife wouldn't even
tell me why she quit.

706
00:46:53,416 --> 00:46:58,421
Sure, it's easy enough
to hire a new one.

707
00:46:59,630 --> 00:47:04,427
Still, it's a shame.
She was a great housekeeper.

708
00:47:04,552 --> 00:47:05,428
I see.

709
00:47:05,553 --> 00:47:08,014
She kept the house
in great shape,

710
00:47:08,222 --> 00:47:10,516
and she knew never to
cross the line.

711
00:47:11,434 --> 00:47:13,936
I can't stand people
who cross the line.

712
00:47:14,645 --> 00:47:17,190
Perhaps just one weak point?

713
00:47:18,149 --> 00:47:19,525
Eating too much.

714
00:47:19,734 --> 00:47:22,320
She always ate enough for two.

715
00:47:23,279 --> 00:47:27,033
But considering
all the work she did...

716
00:47:27,283 --> 00:47:32,455
Then you better find someone new.
A new housekeeper.

717
00:47:32,747 --> 00:47:34,540
We're in trouble now.

718
00:47:34,874 --> 00:47:38,961
In a week,
our house will be a trash can.

719
00:47:40,087 --> 00:47:43,049
My clothes will start to smell.

720
00:47:44,300 --> 00:47:47,136
My wife has no talent
for housework.

721
00:47:47,386 --> 00:47:50,348
She's bad at cleaning,
and her cooking's awful.

722
00:47:51,474 --> 00:47:53,267
Still, you love her, right?

723
00:48:01,317 --> 00:48:04,278
Of course.
I love her.

724
00:48:05,404 --> 00:48:07,240
We'll call it love.

725
00:48:09,200 --> 00:48:10,993
Then would this help?

726
00:48:15,122 --> 00:48:17,500
The Care?
What is this?

727
00:48:17,708 --> 00:48:20,086
I just recently
found out about them.

728
00:48:20,294 --> 00:48:24,799
How to describe it?
It's like a membership service.

729
00:48:25,716 --> 00:48:32,098
The company provides veteran-grade
help to VIP customers such as you.

730
00:48:32,348 --> 00:48:38,187
For example maids, caregivers,
or drivers like myself.

731
00:48:38,354 --> 00:48:41,190
You can tell from the card
they're high-class.

732
00:48:41,941 --> 00:48:43,317
Cool design.

733
00:48:44,735 --> 00:48:46,821
Then how do you
know about this company?

734
00:48:46,862 --> 00:48:51,033
They contacted me,
as a veteran-grade driver.

735
00:48:51,450 --> 00:48:53,327
You might say they scouted me?

736
00:48:54,954 --> 00:49:00,918
But when their call came I had
already arranged to meet with you.

737
00:49:01,085 --> 00:49:03,921
I see...

738
00:49:05,256 --> 00:49:08,217
You turned down this
famous company to work for me.

739
00:49:08,968 --> 00:49:10,136
I won't forget that.

740
00:49:11,762 --> 00:49:13,931
Son of a bitch!

741
00:49:15,975 --> 00:49:20,062
Anyway, I can give this card
to my wife, right?

742
00:49:20,271 --> 00:49:22,023
Yes, that's why I brought it up.

743
00:49:22,106 --> 00:49:23,941
No need to mention me.

744
00:49:25,276 --> 00:49:28,571
You can tell her
you found the company yourself.

745
00:49:29,280 --> 00:49:30,448
Sure.

746
00:49:30,906 --> 00:49:33,159
Thanks to you I can
play the good husband.

747
00:49:33,367 --> 00:49:38,039
On the back, there's
a number for consultations.

748
00:49:38,205 --> 00:49:39,457
Tell her to call there...

749
00:49:39,498 --> 00:49:40,666
Eyes on the road!

750
00:49:45,921 --> 00:49:48,966
Hello, this is Senior Advisor Yeo
of The Care.

751
00:49:49,425 --> 00:49:52,595
Yes, this is The Care's main office?

752
00:49:52,720 --> 00:49:53,596
That's correct.

753
00:49:53,721 --> 00:49:57,099
If she wanted, she'd be
a fucking great con artist.

754
00:49:57,224 --> 00:49:59,477
Isn't her voice tone great?
Takes after me.

755
00:50:01,145 --> 00:50:03,689
From what I've heard,
it's a full membership service?

756
00:50:04,023 --> 00:50:07,902
So you're not currently
a member, I assume?

757
00:50:07,943 --> 00:50:10,488
<i>That's right.
What steps do I need to take?</i>

758
00:50:10,613 --> 00:50:14,700
We'll just need to receive
a few documents from you.

759
00:50:14,825 --> 00:50:17,495
Are you ready to write this down?

760
00:50:17,912 --> 00:50:22,416
Your family register,
citizenship ID cards...

761
00:50:23,459 --> 00:50:26,295
...documents to prove
your income level,

762
00:50:26,545 --> 00:50:28,923
i.e. the title to your property, etc.

763
00:50:29,048 --> 00:50:31,133
Our property title?
Yes.

764
00:50:39,850 --> 00:50:41,143
Wow, peaches!

765
00:50:41,477 --> 00:50:43,229
You have some too, Mr. Kevin.

766
00:50:43,688 --> 00:50:44,730
Thank you.

767
00:50:53,572 --> 00:50:56,534
Leave it outside the door
next time.

768
00:50:56,701 --> 00:50:58,452
- And knock!
- Yes.

769
00:51:01,372 --> 00:51:02,957
No entering during my lesson!

770
00:51:03,082 --> 00:51:04,166
Yes, miss!

771
00:51:06,585 --> 00:51:07,837
<i>Park Da-song!</i>

772
00:51:08,087 --> 00:51:09,171
Daddy!

773
00:51:09,463 --> 00:51:10,548
<i>Where are you?</i>

774
00:51:15,302 --> 00:51:16,262
Daddy!

775
00:51:16,595 --> 00:51:17,430
Son!

776
00:51:17,513 --> 00:51:19,265
Walkie talkies!

777
00:51:19,390 --> 00:51:20,182
Walkie talkies?

778
00:51:20,307 --> 00:51:21,267
Walkie talkies!

779
00:51:21,475 --> 00:51:24,353
Who do you like better,
your dad or the walkie talkie?

780
00:51:25,396 --> 00:51:27,982
Da-song, how could you
run out from your lesson?

781
00:51:28,733 --> 00:51:31,944
When did you buy all this?

782
00:51:32,027 --> 00:51:32,945
It's no big deal.

783
00:51:33,112 --> 00:51:33,779
Huh?

784
00:51:37,324 --> 00:51:37,992
Huh?

785
00:51:38,993 --> 00:51:40,077
What is it?

786
00:51:43,038 --> 00:51:44,165
What's he doing now?

787
00:51:45,708 --> 00:51:46,709
Da-song, don't do that!

788
00:51:46,834 --> 00:51:50,504
It's the same!
They smell the same!

789
00:51:50,755 --> 00:51:54,091
What are you talking about?
Go up to Jessica.

790
00:51:54,425 --> 00:51:58,179
Jessica smells like that, too.

791
00:51:59,263 --> 00:52:02,892
So do we all need to use
different soap, now?

792
00:52:02,933 --> 00:52:06,729
Dad, we'll need to use
different laundry soap, too.

793
00:52:06,937 --> 00:52:08,105
And fabric softener.

794
00:52:08,147 --> 00:52:12,109
You mean doing four separate
loads of laundry each time?

795
00:52:12,568 --> 00:52:14,111
That's not it.

796
00:52:15,070 --> 00:52:16,989
It's the semi-basement smell.

797
00:52:18,157 --> 00:52:20,826
We need to leave this home
to lose the smell.

798
00:52:22,787 --> 00:52:28,834
Anyway, aren't we fortunate to be
worrying about things like this?

799
00:52:28,876 --> 00:52:29,627
Sure.

800
00:52:30,044 --> 00:52:32,838
In an age like ours,

801
00:52:33,255 --> 00:52:37,718
when an opening for a security guard
attracts 500 university graduates.

802
00:52:38,052 --> 00:52:40,930
Our entire family got hired!

803
00:52:41,806 --> 00:52:43,140
That's right, Dad!

804
00:52:43,808 --> 00:52:46,227
If we put our 4 salaries together?

805
00:52:46,560 --> 00:52:50,564
The amount of cash coming from
that house into ours is immense!

806
00:52:51,482 --> 00:52:55,945
Let's offer a prayer of gratitude
to the great Mr. Park.

807
00:52:56,111 --> 00:52:57,154
And to Min!

808
00:52:57,321 --> 00:53:00,032
Ki-woo, that friend of yours
turned into such a fine guy,

809
00:53:00,074 --> 00:53:04,036
and thanks to him we're all...
Fuck, not again!

810
00:53:09,124 --> 00:53:09,959
That asshole's dead.

811
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:12,586
Ki-woo's on the rampage!

812
00:53:12,628 --> 00:53:14,964
Don't overdo it!

813
00:53:16,131 --> 00:53:18,592
Use this instead.

814
00:53:22,346 --> 00:53:23,764
Damn you!

815
00:53:26,433 --> 00:53:27,893
Get a fucking grip!

816
00:53:27,935 --> 00:53:29,562
Get a grip!

817
00:53:31,856 --> 00:53:33,315
Wow!

818
00:53:37,528 --> 00:53:39,822
It's a deluge!

819
00:53:55,963 --> 00:54:00,426
Current weather is clear, over.
The clouds are moving.

820
00:54:00,467 --> 00:54:02,928
<i>But they're not rain clouds, over.</i>

821
00:54:02,970 --> 00:54:04,430
I hear you, over.

822
00:54:04,471 --> 00:54:10,644
Currently your sister's lip
is pouting like a duck's bill.

823
00:54:10,895 --> 00:54:13,522
She's super annoyed, over.

824
00:54:13,981 --> 00:54:18,527
Can't I stay home and study English?
And call Kevin?

825
00:54:18,777 --> 00:54:22,239
Hey! Don't make a scene
just as we're leaving.

826
00:54:22,281 --> 00:54:24,658
If we have to go,
let's have fun.

827
00:54:24,700 --> 00:54:27,369
Da-hye, this is no
ordinary camping trip.

828
00:54:27,411 --> 00:54:28,245
That's right!

829
00:54:28,287 --> 00:54:30,372
How could you miss
your brother's birthday?

830
00:54:30,414 --> 00:54:31,123
No way!

831
00:54:31,206 --> 00:54:33,542
Even your busy father
is taking time off to go.

832
00:54:33,584 --> 00:54:36,170
Right! If you don't go,
you'll regret it!

833
00:54:38,797 --> 00:54:40,883
Oh, right.
You know the beam projector?

834
00:54:41,091 --> 00:54:42,051
The outdoor theater?

835
00:54:42,092 --> 00:54:43,969
Right, bring the outdoor
beam projector.

836
00:54:44,011 --> 00:54:44,678
Yes.

837
00:54:44,803 --> 00:54:48,974
And look for Da-song's
camping raincoat.

838
00:54:49,391 --> 00:54:50,976
He loves it when it rains.

839
00:54:51,518 --> 00:54:55,397
You remember now?
Zoonie, Berry, and Foofoo.

840
00:54:55,439 --> 00:54:56,690
Zoonie and Berry get this.

841
00:54:56,815 --> 00:54:59,568
Yes, Natural Balance Original Ultra.

842
00:54:59,735 --> 00:55:01,862
Right, and for Foofoo...

843
00:55:02,404 --> 00:55:03,989
Kani-kamaboko.
Japanese crab sticks.

844
00:55:04,031 --> 00:55:04,990
Yes.

845
00:55:05,115 --> 00:55:07,993
When you walk Zoonie,
give him a long leash.

846
00:55:08,202 --> 00:55:10,579
He needs to run around
to feel happy.

847
00:55:10,621 --> 00:55:13,707
He's like the canine version
of Da-song!

848
00:55:39,650 --> 00:55:41,235
Son!

849
00:55:41,485 --> 00:55:44,405
Why are you lying down outside?

850
00:55:44,655 --> 00:55:47,199
Isn't he hot out there?

851
00:55:47,866 --> 00:55:52,454
I'm gazing at the sky from home.

852
00:55:54,289 --> 00:55:55,541
It's so great.

853
00:55:59,253 --> 00:56:01,422
Mom, want some water?

854
00:56:01,505 --> 00:56:02,756
There's sparkling, right?

855
00:56:03,090 --> 00:56:05,426
Ki-jung, some water?

856
00:56:05,676 --> 00:56:07,469
Telepathy... thank you.

857
00:56:29,908 --> 00:56:31,160
Whoa.

858
00:56:33,704 --> 00:56:36,373
Wow, all these
varieties of alcohol.

859
00:56:37,833 --> 00:56:41,253
Dad! Let me add
another to the mix!

860
00:56:41,295 --> 00:56:45,466
This is pretty classy.

861
00:56:46,300 --> 00:56:51,305
Rain falling on the lawn,
as we sip our whiskey...

862
00:56:51,555 --> 00:56:55,976
Ki-woo, what's that yellow
notebook you've been carrying?

863
00:56:56,935 --> 00:57:00,397
This? It's Da-hye's diary.

864
00:57:00,522 --> 00:57:01,982
Her diary?

865
00:57:02,066 --> 00:57:06,028
What a scumbag.
How could you read her diary?

866
00:57:06,862 --> 00:57:12,117
Just so we can
understand each other deeper.

867
00:57:12,242 --> 00:57:14,620
Fuck, are you two dating?

868
00:57:15,162 --> 00:57:19,291
I'm serious.
She really likes me too.

869
00:57:21,335 --> 00:57:22,628
A while back...

870
00:57:23,837 --> 00:57:24,922
Never mind.

871
00:57:25,964 --> 00:57:29,051
When she enters university,
I'll officially ask her out.

872
00:57:29,343 --> 00:57:30,344
Seriously.

873
00:57:35,265 --> 00:57:37,017
My son!

874
00:57:37,476 --> 00:57:41,730
Then this house will be
your in-laws' house?

875
00:57:44,399 --> 00:57:45,359
That's right.

876
00:57:45,609 --> 00:57:49,446
Fuck, then I'm washing dishes
at my daughter-in-law's?

877
00:57:49,488 --> 00:57:52,866
Sure, washing your
daughter-in-law's socks!

878
00:58:04,711 --> 00:58:09,883
I like her.
She's a good kid.

879
00:58:10,300 --> 00:58:14,263
She's pretty,
but she's not wild.

880
00:58:15,305 --> 00:58:19,476
Well, now that
we're daydreaming...

881
00:58:20,894 --> 00:58:23,564
If Da-hye and I marry,

882
00:58:23,605 --> 00:58:27,109
we can bring in actors
to be my mom and dad.

883
00:58:28,152 --> 00:58:28,986
Look at her.

884
00:58:29,528 --> 00:58:33,073
She got so many jobs
acting in weddings last year.

885
00:58:33,448 --> 00:58:37,703
I even caught the bouquet
from a bitch I've never met.

886
00:58:37,911 --> 00:58:40,789
If you get the bouquet,
they pay an extra $10.

887
00:58:40,956 --> 00:58:43,083
That's how your acting
got so good!

888
00:58:43,125 --> 00:58:48,505
Acting is one thing, but this
family is so gullible, right?

889
00:58:48,672 --> 00:58:50,924
The madame especially.

890
00:58:50,966 --> 00:58:52,634
You said it.

891
00:58:54,469 --> 00:58:57,806
She's so naive,
and nice.

892
00:58:58,182 --> 00:59:00,100
She's rich, but still nice.

893
00:59:00,184 --> 00:59:02,311
Not "rich, but still nice."

894
00:59:02,686 --> 00:59:06,231
"Nice because she's rich."
You know?

895
00:59:06,857 --> 00:59:13,322
Hell, if I had all this money.

896
00:59:14,489 --> 00:59:18,410
I'd be nice too!

897
00:59:18,702 --> 00:59:19,828
Even nicer!

898
00:59:20,370 --> 00:59:22,539
That's true.
Your mom's right.

899
00:59:22,789 --> 00:59:24,917
Rich people are naive.
No resentments.

900
00:59:25,292 --> 00:59:27,544
No creases on them.

901
00:59:27,669 --> 00:59:30,923
It all gets ironed out.
Money is an iron.

902
00:59:31,173 --> 00:59:33,634
Those creases all get smoothed out.

903
00:59:33,675 --> 00:59:34,843
Hey, Ki-woo.

904
00:59:35,802 --> 00:59:40,557
You know that driver, Yoon?
Was it Yoon?

905
00:59:41,099 --> 00:59:43,477
The driver before me.

906
00:59:43,727 --> 00:59:44,853
Yeah, Yoon.

907
00:59:45,020 --> 00:59:49,566
He must be working
somewhere else now, right?

908
00:59:49,733 --> 00:59:52,069
Sure, he must be.

909
00:59:52,110 --> 00:59:55,364
He's young,
got a nice physique.

910
00:59:55,906 --> 00:59:58,992
He must've found a better job.

911
00:59:59,034 --> 01:00:01,203
Fucking hell!

912
01:00:02,037 --> 01:00:04,289
What's with her now?

913
01:00:04,623 --> 01:00:10,796
We're the ones who need help.
Worry about us, okay?

914
01:00:11,255 --> 01:00:14,466
Dad! Come on, Dad!

915
01:00:14,758 --> 01:00:18,971
Just focus on us, okay?
On us!

916
01:00:19,137 --> 01:00:23,308
Not Driver Yoon, but me, please!

917
01:00:23,558 --> 01:00:25,811
Awesome timing, huh?

918
01:00:25,936 --> 01:00:29,690
She speaks,
and the lightning crashes!

919
01:00:31,650 --> 01:00:34,403
Hey, Jessica. Cheers.

920
01:00:35,445 --> 01:00:41,243
Hey, when I went up before,
and you were in the bath...

921
01:00:41,368 --> 01:00:42,911
What about it?

922
01:00:43,745 --> 01:00:46,999
How to put it?
You fit in here.

923
01:00:47,291 --> 01:00:50,127
This rich house suits you.
Not like us.

924
01:00:50,168 --> 01:00:51,044
Fuck off.

925
01:00:51,169 --> 01:00:52,045
I'm serious!

926
01:00:52,087 --> 01:00:53,839
Dad, before...

927
01:00:53,880 --> 01:00:56,425
She was lying back in the tub,
watching TV.

928
01:00:57,175 --> 01:00:59,511
Like she's lived here for years.

929
01:01:01,388 --> 01:01:07,269
Speaking of which,
if this became our house,

930
01:01:07,477 --> 01:01:11,565
if we lived here,
which room would you want?

931
01:01:11,815 --> 01:01:16,945
What room in this masterwork
by the great Namgoong?

932
01:01:17,112 --> 01:01:19,031
Fuck, I don't know.

933
01:01:19,072 --> 01:01:22,534
Get me the house first.
Then I'll think about it.

934
01:01:23,076 --> 01:01:25,162
We live here now, don't we?

935
01:01:25,829 --> 01:01:29,541
Getting drunk in the living room.

936
01:01:29,708 --> 01:01:32,753
Right, we live here.
Why not?

937
01:01:32,836 --> 01:01:37,299
This is our home right now.
It's cosy.

938
01:01:37,591 --> 01:01:40,385
Cosy?
Are you feeling cosy?

939
01:01:40,635 --> 01:01:45,390
Sure, but suppose Park
walked through that door now.

940
01:01:46,141 --> 01:01:47,601
What about your dad?

941
01:01:47,726 --> 01:01:50,979
He'd run and hide
like a cockroach.

942
01:01:51,605 --> 01:01:54,107
Kids, you know at our house,

943
01:01:54,149 --> 01:01:59,696
when you turn on the light,
and the cockroaches scatter?

944
01:01:59,946 --> 01:02:01,490
You know what I mean?

945
01:02:02,449 --> 01:02:05,410
I'm getting fucking tired of this.

946
01:02:06,161 --> 01:02:07,829
- A cockroach?
- Yeah.

947
01:02:11,750 --> 01:02:13,335
Huh? What's wrong?

948
01:02:13,460 --> 01:02:14,836
What's the matter?

949
01:02:14,878 --> 01:02:18,590
Dad, don't do that.
You only live once.

950
01:02:25,847 --> 01:02:27,599
What the hell?

951
01:02:27,766 --> 01:02:29,434
I fooled you! Didn't I?

952
01:02:29,476 --> 01:02:30,727
Jesus, Dad.

953
01:02:30,894 --> 01:02:34,940
I fooled you too, Ki-woo?
Did it look for real?

954
01:02:35,065 --> 01:02:38,443
If it was for real,
I'd fucking kill you.

955
01:02:38,860 --> 01:02:42,531
What is this?
Fucking puppy.

956
01:02:48,412 --> 01:02:50,455
Who is it at this hour?

957
01:02:50,789 --> 01:02:52,332
What is it?

958
01:02:58,797 --> 01:02:59,965
What's she doing here?

959
01:03:00,006 --> 01:03:02,759
The old housekeeper?

960
01:03:03,385 --> 01:03:05,178
What's she here for?

961
01:03:05,720 --> 01:03:09,558
She won't stop ringing it.

962
01:03:10,725 --> 01:03:13,478
Raising a racket.

963
01:03:14,938 --> 01:03:15,856
Who is it?

964
01:03:15,939 --> 01:03:20,402
Oh, hello! I'm...

965
01:03:20,819 --> 01:03:22,487
The madame's not in, right?

966
01:03:22,529 --> 01:03:23,405
What?

967
01:03:23,530 --> 01:03:27,784
I worked here
for a very long time.

968
01:03:28,535 --> 01:03:34,166
Above the monitor there,
you see a photo of 3 dogs, right?

969
01:03:34,332 --> 01:03:35,792
Zoonie, Berry, Foofoo.

970
01:03:35,834 --> 01:03:40,213
I get it,
but why are you here?

971
01:03:40,464 --> 01:03:44,801
You're my successor
as housekeeper, right?

972
01:03:49,973 --> 01:03:51,600
Anyway...

973
01:03:52,350 --> 01:03:55,520
I'm very sorry to
call on you so late.

974
01:03:55,854 --> 01:03:57,397
It's just that...

975
01:03:57,939 --> 01:04:04,696
I forgot something in the
basement under the kitchen.

976
01:04:05,489 --> 01:04:11,620
When I left,
they pushed me out so quickly...

977
01:04:14,998 --> 01:04:16,833
Would you let me in?

978
01:04:19,169 --> 01:04:20,962
What do we do?

979
01:04:21,588 --> 01:04:23,757
This isn't in the plan.

980
01:04:31,598 --> 01:04:33,058
Sorry for the trouble.

981
01:04:34,100 --> 01:04:34,976
This way.

982
01:04:35,018 --> 01:04:36,353
Yes, thank you.

983
01:04:38,522 --> 01:04:40,649
You can put your raincoat...

984
01:04:40,774 --> 01:04:42,984
It'll just be a second.

985
01:04:43,902 --> 01:04:47,489
Quite a meal there.
That'll be a job to clean up.

986
01:04:47,697 --> 01:04:50,742
But what did you leave below?

987
01:04:55,497 --> 01:04:57,874
Want to come down with me?

988
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:02,254
Well, just go ahead.

989
01:05:55,599 --> 01:05:58,643
Help me push this!

990
01:05:59,102 --> 01:06:01,646
Pull it! From over there.

991
01:06:01,688 --> 01:06:02,939
What?

992
01:06:03,398 --> 01:06:04,149
Pull!

993
01:06:06,985 --> 01:06:08,528
Pull it hard!

994
01:06:12,407 --> 01:06:13,575
Are you okay?

995
01:06:15,118 --> 01:06:16,369
Did I scare you?

996
01:06:18,997 --> 01:06:20,457
Thank you!

997
01:06:21,916 --> 01:06:22,959
Thank you.

998
01:06:31,426 --> 01:06:32,385
Honey!

999
01:06:32,427 --> 01:06:33,178
What the hell?

1000
01:06:34,929 --> 01:06:35,972
Hey!

1001
01:06:36,014 --> 01:06:37,474
Honey!

1002
01:06:38,642 --> 01:06:40,060
Honey!

1003
01:06:42,646 --> 01:06:43,480
Wait!

1004
01:06:43,897 --> 01:06:45,982
Honey, I'm here!

1005
01:06:46,149 --> 01:06:47,108
What is all this?

1006
01:06:49,944 --> 01:06:50,487
Honey!

1007
01:06:51,404 --> 01:06:53,114
Honey, I'm fine.

1008
01:06:53,156 --> 01:06:54,616
No you're not!

1009
01:06:55,158 --> 01:06:56,076
I'm fine, really.

1010
01:06:56,117 --> 01:06:57,410
How can you say that?

1011
01:06:57,452 --> 01:06:59,287
But I'm really hungry.

1012
01:06:59,329 --> 01:07:00,288
Suck it!

1013
01:07:00,330 --> 01:07:03,291
How many days has it been?

1014
01:07:03,625 --> 01:07:05,001
You must've been so hungry!

1015
01:07:07,337 --> 01:07:08,588
It's okay.

1016
01:07:08,755 --> 01:07:11,424
She's a nice woman.
She let me in.

1017
01:07:11,549 --> 01:07:13,718
There was an iron plate,
for grilling meat.

1018
01:07:13,760 --> 01:07:15,303
It was wedged under the shelf.

1019
01:07:15,345 --> 01:07:16,429
So that's why.

1020
01:07:16,471 --> 01:07:19,808
I couldn't open it from the inside.

1021
01:07:19,974 --> 01:07:23,144
- What's going on here?
- I know you must be startled.

1022
01:07:23,645 --> 01:07:25,897
I would be too in this situation.

1023
01:07:26,356 --> 01:07:30,819
But as two fellow workers...
Right, Chung-sook?

1024
01:07:30,985 --> 01:07:33,446
How do you know my name?

1025
01:07:34,364 --> 01:07:38,827
To be honest I'm still texting
with the boy Da-song.

1026
01:07:39,160 --> 01:07:43,748
I knew they were going camping,
so I came today.

1027
01:07:43,790 --> 01:07:46,334
I wanted to speak to you alone.

1028
01:07:46,710 --> 01:07:47,544
<i>Talking about.</i>

1029
01:07:50,380 --> 01:07:52,674
Don't worry, Chung-sook.

1030
01:07:52,799 --> 01:07:56,344
I cut the wire
on the CCTV by the gate.

1031
01:07:56,678 --> 01:08:00,265
Nobody knows I came.
Isn't that good, sis?

1032
01:08:00,390 --> 01:08:02,475
Don't call me sis!

1033
01:08:02,517 --> 01:08:05,186
Sis, my name is Moon-gwang.

1034
01:08:05,729 --> 01:08:10,066
This is my hubbie Oh Geun-sae.
Say hello, honey.

1035
01:08:10,233 --> 01:08:13,570
This tastes great.
What happened to your face?

1036
01:08:13,611 --> 01:08:16,990
I'll tell you later.

1037
01:08:17,031 --> 01:08:20,994
So you'd steal food every day
while working in the kitchen.

1038
01:08:21,035 --> 01:08:22,162
Feeding your husband.

1039
01:08:22,203 --> 01:08:26,791
Not at all! I bought
all his food with my salary.

1040
01:08:26,916 --> 01:08:29,878
That's so unfair!

1041
01:08:30,128 --> 01:08:32,797
But how long has
your husband been down here?

1042
01:08:32,839 --> 01:08:35,300
Hold on a sec.
4 years?

1043
01:08:36,050 --> 01:08:38,887
4 years, 3 months
and 17 days.

1044
01:08:38,928 --> 01:08:40,597
Right, it's June now.

1045
01:08:41,264 --> 01:08:47,020
Four years ago when
Mr. Namgoong moved to Paris,

1046
01:08:47,520 --> 01:08:50,190
in the time before
Mr. Park's family moved in,

1047
01:08:50,648 --> 01:08:54,110
I brought my husband down here.

1048
01:08:54,235 --> 01:08:59,032
Many rich houses have secret bunkers,
where you can hide

1049
01:08:59,365 --> 01:09:03,620
in case North Korea attacks,
or if creditors break in.

1050
01:09:03,953 --> 01:09:09,834
But it seems Mr. Namgoong was
a bit embarrassed about this,

1051
01:09:10,293 --> 01:09:14,047
because he never mentioned it
to Mr. Park's family.

1052
01:09:14,297 --> 01:09:15,632
So only I know about it.

1053
01:09:15,673 --> 01:09:18,051
So that's how it happened.

1054
01:09:18,301 --> 01:09:22,430
But now that I know, I've no
choice but to call the police!

1055
01:09:22,472 --> 01:09:24,557
No please, sis!

1056
01:09:25,558 --> 01:09:27,852
As fellow members
of the needy, please don't.

1057
01:09:27,894 --> 01:09:29,354
I'm not needy!

1058
01:09:29,395 --> 01:09:33,066
But we're needy!

1059
01:09:33,316 --> 01:09:37,529
We've no house, no money,
only debts!

1060
01:09:37,904 --> 01:09:38,947
Sis, please!

1061
01:09:39,113 --> 01:09:43,535
Even after 4 years of hiding,
those debt collectors won't give up.

1062
01:09:43,701 --> 01:09:47,789
They're still searching for him,
threatening to stab him.

1063
01:09:47,914 --> 01:09:49,374
You used loan sharks?

1064
01:09:50,416 --> 01:09:52,293
It's all my fault.

1065
01:09:52,836 --> 01:09:54,087
The Taiwan cake shop.

1066
01:09:54,712 --> 01:09:58,800
My Taiwanese Wangshui
castella shop went bust.

1067
01:09:58,842 --> 01:10:01,052
I was overwhelmed by debt.

1068
01:10:01,219 --> 01:10:02,679
Please take this.

1069
01:10:03,137 --> 01:10:04,180
What's that?

1070
01:10:04,722 --> 01:10:08,810
It's not much,
just a modest sum.

1071
01:10:09,018 --> 01:10:11,688
But we'll send it
to you every month.

1072
01:10:12,105 --> 01:10:13,898
In return,
just once every 2 days,

1073
01:10:13,940 --> 01:10:17,068
please leave him some food.

1074
01:10:17,735 --> 01:10:20,613
No no, just once a week.

1075
01:10:21,322 --> 01:10:23,700
There's a refrigerator here.
Just once a week.

1076
01:10:23,741 --> 01:10:26,286
You've got some nerve!
I'm calling the police.

1077
01:10:26,327 --> 01:10:27,203
Sis!

1078
01:10:30,248 --> 01:10:31,416
Who is that?

1079
01:10:34,627 --> 01:10:36,337
Wait... Jessica?

1080
01:10:37,255 --> 01:10:38,131
Mr. Kim?

1081
01:10:38,381 --> 01:10:39,132
What the hell?

1082
01:10:40,758 --> 01:10:42,093
Dad, my ankle!

1083
01:10:42,135 --> 01:10:43,344
You okay? Sorry.

1084
01:10:43,386 --> 01:10:45,346
Dad, my foot.

1085
01:10:45,388 --> 01:10:46,723
Don't call me Dad!

1086
01:10:54,272 --> 01:10:58,109
I thought it was weird
when the driver was fired.

1087
01:10:59,193 --> 01:10:59,736
Hey!

1088
01:10:59,777 --> 01:11:02,238
- Let's talk things over.
- What the hell?

1089
01:11:02,280 --> 01:11:03,740
Are you some
family of charlatans?

1090
01:11:03,781 --> 01:11:04,657
So, sis...

1091
01:11:04,699 --> 01:11:06,868
Don't fucking call me sis,
you filthy bitch!

1092
01:11:07,410 --> 01:11:12,540
I'm gonna send this video
to the madame, how about that?

1093
01:11:12,582 --> 01:11:14,459
<i>Dad, my foot.</i>

1094
01:11:14,918 --> 01:11:16,753
No reception in
the basement, right?

1095
01:11:17,587 --> 01:11:19,547
- The phone works fine.
- Fuck.

1096
01:11:19,589 --> 01:11:24,260
Ma'am, to be honest,
the jobs we have here...

1097
01:11:24,302 --> 01:11:27,263
Shut up!
It's too late now!

1098
01:11:27,430 --> 01:11:30,767
Let's all go to jail!
We're fucking going down!

1099
01:11:30,808 --> 01:11:33,978
Lady, are you crazy?

1100
01:11:34,520 --> 01:11:39,567
If they see that video, Mr. Park
and his wife will be so shocked!

1101
01:11:39,943 --> 01:11:42,987
What did those nice people
ever do wrong?

1102
01:11:43,821 --> 01:11:44,697
Why do this to them?

1103
01:11:44,739 --> 01:11:46,157
Stop right there!

1104
01:11:46,532 --> 01:11:48,701
Or I'll push the 'send' button.

1105
01:11:49,035 --> 01:11:50,662
Follow me.

1106
01:11:51,245 --> 01:11:53,581
Calm down, ma'am.

1107
01:11:57,210 --> 01:11:59,212
Don't push!

1108
01:12:00,546 --> 01:12:01,714
Let's go up, honey.

1109
01:12:02,465 --> 01:12:05,176
Time for you
to get some fresh air!

1110
01:12:22,485 --> 01:12:28,533
Honey, this 'send' button
is like a missile launcher.

1111
01:12:28,992 --> 01:12:30,451
What do you mean, honey?

1112
01:12:31,369 --> 01:12:36,457
If we threaten to push it,
those people can't do anything.

1113
01:12:36,749 --> 01:12:40,920
It's like a North Korean rocket.
A North Korean missile button!

1114
01:12:42,505 --> 01:12:46,259
Today our beloved
Great Leader Kim Jong-un,

1115
01:12:46,300 --> 01:12:49,345
after witnessing the
charlatan family video,

1116
01:12:49,512 --> 01:12:52,265
was unable to contain
his shock and fury

1117
01:12:52,306 --> 01:12:55,643
at their wicked,
despicable provocation!

1118
01:12:55,685 --> 01:12:57,478
I've missed your jokes, honey!

1119
01:12:57,520 --> 01:13:02,150
Therefore our Great Leader,
in this age of denuclearization,

1120
01:13:02,191 --> 01:13:07,989
has commanded that the nation's
last remaining nuclear warhead

1121
01:13:08,031 --> 01:13:10,575
be driven down the throats
of this wicked family!

1122
01:13:10,616 --> 01:13:15,371
No one can imitate North Korean
news anchors like you!

1123
01:13:15,413 --> 01:13:20,501
With their stinking guts serving
as the last nuclear graveyard,

1124
01:13:20,543 --> 01:13:25,381
our Dear Leader's wish to denuclearize
and bring world peace can...

1125
01:13:25,548 --> 01:13:27,258
Hands in the air, fuckers!

1126
01:13:27,842 --> 01:13:28,885
Higher!

1127
01:13:31,137 --> 01:13:33,014
You scumbag family.

1128
01:13:33,306 --> 01:13:34,098
Husband?

1129
01:13:34,640 --> 01:13:35,308
Husband.

1130
01:13:35,349 --> 01:13:36,017
Wife?

1131
01:13:36,350 --> 01:13:36,976
Yes.

1132
01:13:37,226 --> 01:13:37,810
Son?

1133
01:13:38,352 --> 01:13:38,811
Yes.

1134
01:13:38,936 --> 01:13:39,520
Daughter?

1135
01:13:39,645 --> 01:13:40,188
Daughter.

1136
01:13:40,354 --> 01:13:42,190
You neanderthals.

1137
01:13:42,356 --> 01:13:46,486
Is that all you can think to do,
drink yourselves stupid?

1138
01:13:46,861 --> 01:13:51,908
In this home suffused with
Mr. Namgoong's creative spirit?

1139
01:13:52,241 --> 01:13:53,201
You cretins!

1140
01:13:53,367 --> 01:13:54,619
What do you know about art?

1141
01:13:54,744 --> 01:13:56,704
What would they know?

1142
01:13:57,663 --> 01:14:05,546
When the sun was nice,
we'd bask in those sunbeams, right?

1143
01:14:06,339 --> 01:14:10,718
At such moments we could feel
his artistic touch.

1144
01:14:58,808 --> 01:15:02,103
Give it to me!

1145
01:15:21,247 --> 01:15:24,709
Good job! Delete it!

1146
01:15:26,043 --> 01:15:28,296
Careful, don't send it
by accident.

1147
01:15:43,060 --> 01:15:43,936
Hello?

1148
01:15:44,854 --> 01:15:48,024
Listen, do you know how
to make ram-don?

1149
01:15:48,858 --> 01:15:50,026
Ram-don?

1150
01:15:50,193 --> 01:15:53,529
Da-song likes ram-don
more than anything.

1151
01:15:54,071 --> 01:15:57,450
If you boil the water now,
the timing will be perfect.

1152
01:15:57,867 --> 01:16:00,536
<i>There's sirloin in the fridge,
add that too.</i>

1153
01:16:00,703 --> 01:16:02,246
Then, the camping...?

1154
01:16:02,288 --> 01:16:05,666
<i>My god, what a disaster.</i>

1155
01:16:06,375 --> 01:16:11,464
The river overflowed and
everyone was packing their tents,

1156
01:16:11,964 --> 01:16:14,926
but Da-song was crying and
refusing to go home.

1157
01:16:15,092 --> 01:16:18,846
<i>Anyway, ram-don
as soon as we walk in, okay?</i>

1158
01:16:19,305 --> 01:16:21,557
Then you're almost here?

1159
01:16:21,891 --> 01:16:24,143
8 minutes,
according to the GPS.

1160
01:16:24,810 --> 01:16:25,937
You arrive in 8 minutes...

1161
01:16:25,978 --> 01:16:29,357
<i>Start boiling
the water right away!</i>

1162
01:16:33,736 --> 01:16:35,071
What the hell is ram-don?

1163
01:16:44,497 --> 01:16:45,957
Move, quickly!

1164
01:16:47,208 --> 01:16:48,668
Hurry!

1165
01:16:55,925 --> 01:16:57,677
<i>Ramen / Udon</i>

1166
01:16:59,428 --> 01:17:02,223
Dad, I can't drag her
any further!

1167
01:17:13,526 --> 01:17:15,194
What are you doing?

1168
01:17:16,654 --> 01:17:18,114
Dad!

1169
01:17:21,242 --> 01:17:24,412
Go up quickly!
Help upstairs.

1170
01:17:32,169 --> 01:17:32,837
Take this!

1171
01:17:52,690 --> 01:17:53,858
Welcome home!

1172
01:17:53,983 --> 01:17:57,028
Da-song, look!
Let's eat ram-don!

1173
01:17:59,488 --> 01:18:00,656
<i>Da-song!</i>

1174
01:18:03,617 --> 01:18:05,286
<i>Da-song!</i>

1175
01:18:11,917 --> 01:18:13,252
Madame!

1176
01:18:31,729 --> 01:18:33,981
Why don't you just
eat the ram-don?

1177
01:18:34,148 --> 01:18:34,774
Shall I?

1178
01:18:35,024 --> 01:18:37,985
No wait.
I can give it to my husband.

1179
01:18:38,152 --> 01:18:39,904
There's sirloin in here.

1180
01:18:42,656 --> 01:18:46,202
It's cooked through?
<i>Medium well done.</i>

1181
01:19:11,352 --> 01:19:17,441
<i>Returning after a day's work...
I love you so much, Mr. Park!</i>

1182
01:19:17,650 --> 01:19:23,823
<i>Home from the office,
Mr. Park is off duty now.</i>

1183
01:19:25,783 --> 01:19:30,162
Returning after a day's work...
I love you so much, Mr. Park!

1184
01:19:30,204 --> 01:19:31,956
- What are you doing?
- Shut up!

1185
01:19:43,717 --> 01:19:45,886
Honey, do you want
some ram-don?

1186
01:19:46,303 --> 01:19:47,388
Da-song doesn't want it?

1187
01:19:47,430 --> 01:19:48,055
No.

1188
01:19:48,222 --> 01:19:49,765
No, I'm tired.
I'm going to bed.

1189
01:19:50,433 --> 01:19:53,060
Why are you staring?

1190
01:19:54,395 --> 01:19:57,982
Mr. Park, you feed me
and house me.

1191
01:19:58,023 --> 01:19:59,191
<i>Respect!</i>

1192
01:20:01,444 --> 01:20:02,903
You do this every day?

1193
01:20:03,696 --> 01:20:08,909
Sure, I even send whole
sentences to thank him.

1194
01:20:09,702 --> 01:20:11,871
Someone of your age
should know it.

1195
01:20:12,037 --> 01:20:12,788
Know what?

1196
01:20:12,955 --> 01:20:14,415
Morse Code.

1197
01:20:15,332 --> 01:20:19,003
That sensor's going batty.

1198
01:20:27,553 --> 01:20:30,806
Da-song will know it,
since he's a Scout.

1199
01:20:31,140 --> 01:20:32,600
It's ridiculous, right?

1200
01:20:32,975 --> 01:20:36,103
Running around,
trying to please a kid.

1201
01:20:36,562 --> 01:20:38,314
He's not some kind of prince.

1202
01:20:38,647 --> 01:20:41,025
He's the youngest.
It's common.

1203
01:20:42,359 --> 01:20:43,611
Please understand.

1204
01:20:44,361 --> 01:20:47,907
Da-song is a bit... unwell.

1205
01:20:48,491 --> 01:20:51,202
He's receiving trauma therapy
and art therapy.

1206
01:20:52,453 --> 01:20:54,413
There was an incident.

1207
01:20:54,580 --> 01:20:55,623
What incident?

1208
01:20:56,248 --> 01:20:59,835
Sis, you believe in ghosts, too?

1209
01:21:01,295 --> 01:21:04,840
Da-song saw a ghost in the house
when he was in 1st grade.

1210
01:21:11,472 --> 01:21:13,849
He had a birthday party
at home that day.

1211
01:21:14,266 --> 01:21:16,727
Late that night,
when everyone was sleeping,

1212
01:21:16,810 --> 01:21:21,065
Da-song crept down to the kitchen
and took the cake out.

1213
01:21:21,482 --> 01:21:24,485
The whipped cream
on that cake was amazing.

1214
01:21:24,610 --> 01:21:27,238
Even in bed, he couldn't
stop thinking about it.

1215
01:21:27,821 --> 01:21:33,160
So Da-song was sitting,
eating his cake...

1216
01:21:43,003 --> 01:21:45,673
He screamed,
and I ran downstairs,

1217
01:21:46,423 --> 01:21:48,175
and he was all...

1218
01:21:49,051 --> 01:21:54,014
his eyes rolled back in his head,
convulsions, foam in his mouth.

1219
01:21:56,308 --> 01:21:58,602
Have you ever seen a child
have a seizure?

1220
01:21:58,727 --> 01:21:59,520
No.

1221
01:21:59,562 --> 01:22:04,692
They need 15-minute treatment,
or they're done for.

1222
01:22:04,942 --> 01:22:09,822
That's the time you have to reach
an emergency room, 15 minutes.

1223
01:22:11,657 --> 01:22:15,911
How can you live
in a place like this?

1224
01:22:16,036 --> 01:22:19,039
Well, lots of people
live underground.

1225
01:22:19,331 --> 01:22:21,208
Especially if you count
semi-basements.

1226
01:22:21,333 --> 01:22:25,546
What'll you do?
You don't have a plan?

1227
01:22:26,088 --> 01:22:29,341
I just feel comfortable here.

1228
01:22:30,759 --> 01:22:33,637
It feels like I was born here.

1229
01:22:34,680 --> 01:22:37,641
Maybe I had
my wedding here, too.

1230
01:22:38,058 --> 01:22:41,145
As for the National Pension,
I don't qualify.

1231
01:22:42,605 --> 01:22:45,858
In my old age,
love will comfort me.

1232
01:22:47,610 --> 01:22:52,823
So please.
Let me live down here.

1233
01:22:54,617 --> 01:22:56,076
Anyway...

1234
01:22:56,785 --> 01:23:01,665
My husband was away on business,
so I had to deal with it all.

1235
01:23:02,625 --> 01:23:06,754
Since then we've always
gone out for his birthday.

1236
01:23:07,004 --> 01:23:09,757
Last year my mother's house,
this year, camping.

1237
01:23:10,132 --> 01:23:14,762
Da-song's dad says it's
just a part of growing up.

1238
01:23:15,137 --> 01:23:19,600
They say a ghost in the
house brings wealth.

1239
01:23:21,143 --> 01:23:25,773
Actually, the money's
been good recently.

1240
01:23:52,675 --> 01:23:54,426
Thank god.

1241
01:24:20,994 --> 01:24:23,914
Just stay here for now.

1242
01:24:34,800 --> 01:24:36,552
Zoonie, what's wrong?

1243
01:24:38,804 --> 01:24:40,055
Something under there?

1244
01:24:42,015 --> 01:24:43,434
What is it?

1245
01:24:44,727 --> 01:24:45,686
Damn it!

1246
01:24:47,479 --> 01:24:48,480
- Mom!
- Yeah?

1247
01:24:48,689 --> 01:24:50,983
- How could you?
- What?

1248
01:24:51,191 --> 01:24:55,070
I like ram-don too!
How could you not even ask me?

1249
01:24:55,529 --> 01:24:56,196
Well...

1250
01:24:56,238 --> 01:25:00,284
Da-song didn't want it, so you
asked Dad, then ate it yourself.

1251
01:25:00,409 --> 01:25:01,285
Want her to make one?

1252
01:25:01,326 --> 01:25:03,287
That's not the point!

1253
01:25:03,328 --> 01:25:07,082
- Stop fighting over ramen!
- Why didn't you ask me?

1254
01:25:07,124 --> 01:25:10,294
Oh, stop it! Just go to bed.
Go get changed.

1255
01:25:14,214 --> 01:25:15,466
This way!

1256
01:25:17,760 --> 01:25:18,218
And Ki-jung?

1257
01:25:18,260 --> 01:25:21,221
Under there! Hurry!

1258
01:25:24,725 --> 01:25:27,102
One, two, three! One, two three!

1259
01:25:27,144 --> 01:25:28,395
Da-song?

1260
01:25:28,645 --> 01:25:31,023
Da-song, cut it out!

1261
01:25:31,648 --> 01:25:34,026
He's gone crazy!
Get an umbrella.

1262
01:25:34,568 --> 01:25:35,736
Hey Park Da-song!

1263
01:25:37,571 --> 01:25:42,409
What a monster.
What the hell is he doing?

1264
01:25:42,451 --> 01:25:46,330
Da-song, it's time for bed!
You know how late it is?

1265
01:25:46,371 --> 01:25:47,039
Here.

1266
01:25:48,290 --> 01:25:49,333
Honey, here.

1267
01:25:53,295 --> 01:25:59,635
Who do you take after to be
so stubborn! Look at this rain!

1268
01:26:05,307 --> 01:26:08,018
<i>OMG Kevin.
Da-song camping in the yard.</i>

1269
01:26:11,897 --> 01:26:16,026
Hey, channel 3 for emergencies!
Keep it turned on.

1270
01:26:16,902 --> 01:26:20,072
Let me have it.
I can't believe him.

1271
01:26:20,197 --> 01:26:22,533
Just leave him.
He'll come in if he's tired.

1272
01:26:23,075 --> 01:26:25,786
<i>- I want you here, honey.
- I'm with you.</i>

1273
01:26:25,911 --> 01:26:27,037
Hey, Da-hye!

1274
01:26:27,204 --> 01:26:29,456
Stop using your phone.
Go to bed.

1275
01:26:30,123 --> 01:26:32,668
Go sleep in your room.
We'll take care of things.

1276
01:26:32,918 --> 01:26:35,963
This is the living room,
do you copy?

1277
01:26:36,004 --> 01:26:37,172
<i>Copy, over.</i>

1278
01:26:37,214 --> 01:26:41,385
Daddy is standing by
for emergencies, over.

1279
01:26:41,510 --> 01:26:43,971
<i>Got it, over.</i>

1280
01:26:45,222 --> 01:26:47,182
Is that tent going to leak?

1281
01:26:47,349 --> 01:26:50,561
We ordered from the U.S.,
it'll be fine.

1282
01:26:50,811 --> 01:26:53,605
- Should we sleep here?
- What?

1283
01:26:53,939 --> 01:26:55,899
We've got a full view of the tent.

1284
01:26:56,233 --> 01:26:58,110
Good idea.
I'll feel much better.

1285
01:26:58,151 --> 01:26:58,819
Right?

1286
01:26:59,027 --> 01:27:00,696
Let's watch over him as we sleep.

1287
01:27:02,948 --> 01:27:04,116
What a kid...

1288
01:27:13,876 --> 01:27:14,918
Wait a minute.

1289
01:27:17,838 --> 01:27:19,715
Where's that smell coming from?

1290
01:27:19,882 --> 01:27:21,008
What smell?

1291
01:27:21,550 --> 01:27:22,843
Mr. Kim's smell.

1292
01:27:23,468 --> 01:27:24,803
- Mr. Kim?
- Yeah.

1293
01:27:25,762 --> 01:27:27,139
Not sure what you mean.

1294
01:27:27,180 --> 01:27:30,017
Really?
You must have smelled it.

1295
01:27:30,642 --> 01:27:34,438
That smell that wafts through
the car, how to describe it?

1296
01:27:34,563 --> 01:27:37,024
- An old man's smell?
- No no, it's not that.

1297
01:27:37,065 --> 01:27:38,942
What is it?

1298
01:27:39,776 --> 01:27:41,361
Like an old radish?

1299
01:27:42,362 --> 01:27:43,238
No.

1300
01:27:43,697 --> 01:27:45,949
You know when you boil a rag?

1301
01:27:45,991 --> 01:27:47,034
It smells like that.

1302
01:27:49,912 --> 01:27:56,376
Anyway, even though he always
seems about to cross the line,

1303
01:27:56,418 --> 01:27:59,338
he never does cross it.
That's good.

1304
01:27:59,713 --> 01:28:01,048
- I'll give him credit.
- Yeah.

1305
01:28:02,507 --> 01:28:04,885
But that smell crosses the line.

1306
01:28:05,510 --> 01:28:07,679
It powers through
right into the back seat.

1307
01:28:08,096 --> 01:28:09,681
How bad can it be?

1308
01:28:10,015 --> 01:28:10,891
I don't know.

1309
01:28:11,934 --> 01:28:14,269
It's hard to describe.

1310
01:28:15,520 --> 01:28:18,982
But you sometimes smell it
on the subway.

1311
01:28:19,232 --> 01:28:22,277
It's been ages
since I rode a subway.

1312
01:28:23,111 --> 01:28:25,989
People who ride the subway
have a special smell.

1313
01:28:26,239 --> 01:28:27,282
Yeah.

1314
01:28:43,757 --> 01:28:46,510
Isn't this like
the car's back seat?

1315
01:28:47,469 --> 01:28:50,597
What if Da-song comes back in?

1316
01:28:51,431 --> 01:28:52,808
Don't worry!

1317
01:28:53,558 --> 01:28:56,019
I can just pull my hand back.

1318
01:29:01,775 --> 01:29:03,193
We shouldn't...

1319
01:29:09,741 --> 01:29:11,118
Do it clockwise.

1320
01:29:11,868 --> 01:29:12,536
Right.

1321
01:29:16,164 --> 01:29:19,418
You know where.

1322
01:29:35,976 --> 01:29:39,479
You still have those cheap panties?

1323
01:29:40,105 --> 01:29:40,772
Huh?

1324
01:29:41,273 --> 01:29:43,775
The ones Yoon's girlfriend
left behind.

1325
01:29:45,193 --> 01:29:47,988
If you wear those,
I'll get really fucking hard.

1326
01:29:48,822 --> 01:29:49,865
Really?

1327
01:29:50,699 --> 01:29:53,368
Then buy me drugs.

1328
01:29:54,327 --> 01:29:57,581
Buy me drugs!

1329
01:29:58,999 --> 01:30:00,083
Eat this instead.

1330
01:30:12,512 --> 01:30:13,305
You like it?

1331
01:30:34,743 --> 01:30:36,828
<i>They're passed out cold.
Sneak out now.</i>

1332
01:31:10,904 --> 01:31:13,323
<i>Emergency!
Emergency, over!</i>

1333
01:31:15,867 --> 01:31:17,244
<i>- Emergency!</i>
- What?

1334
01:31:18,286 --> 01:31:19,371
What is it, over!

1335
01:31:19,704 --> 01:31:21,039
Da-song, what's wrong?

1336
01:31:21,373 --> 01:31:23,458
<i>I can't sleep, over.</i>

1337
01:31:23,917 --> 01:31:27,671
So stop it and come in, okay?

1338
01:31:27,921 --> 01:31:30,549
Go sleep in your soft bed, over.

1339
01:31:30,715 --> 01:31:31,883
Right!

1340
01:31:32,134 --> 01:31:34,094
<i>I don't want to, over.</i>

1341
01:31:34,803 --> 01:31:36,096
Hey, Park Da-song.

1342
01:31:41,601 --> 01:31:43,603
Let's just sleep...

1343
01:33:18,698 --> 01:33:22,077
How did it turn out back there?

1344
01:33:23,245 --> 01:33:23,995
What?

1345
01:33:26,623 --> 01:33:28,583
The people in the basement.

1346
01:33:31,628 --> 01:33:35,882
Well, I tied them up.

1347
01:33:36,508 --> 01:33:38,176
What will we do now?

1348
01:33:39,636 --> 01:33:40,470
Huh?

1349
01:33:43,014 --> 01:33:46,184
What do we do now,
what's our plan?

1350
01:33:47,143 --> 01:33:49,896
I've been wondering...

1351
01:33:50,855 --> 01:33:54,025
What would Min do
in this situation?

1352
01:33:55,735 --> 01:33:57,904
Min wouldn't be
in this situation!

1353
01:34:00,073 --> 01:34:05,620
Look kids, we made it
out of there safely, right?

1354
01:34:07,038 --> 01:34:12,210
And besides us, nobody knows
what happened there. Right?

1355
01:34:12,460 --> 01:34:15,046
So nothing happened.
You understand?

1356
01:34:16,464 --> 01:34:20,760
I've got my own plan.

1357
01:34:21,386 --> 01:34:25,015
So you two just
forget about it, okay?

1358
01:34:25,557 --> 01:34:27,058
Let's go home.

1359
01:34:28,184 --> 01:34:30,145
Let's go take a bath.

1360
01:34:49,122 --> 01:34:51,291
What are you doing there?
Hurry up!

1361
01:35:05,013 --> 01:35:07,098
What's going on?

1362
01:35:09,601 --> 01:35:12,103
You stay there.
This is all sewage water.

1363
01:35:12,437 --> 01:35:14,481
Was our window open?

1364
01:35:19,361 --> 01:35:21,988
Help me out, Ki-taek!

1365
01:35:30,538 --> 01:35:31,623
Ki-woo!

1366
01:35:34,334 --> 01:35:37,128
Hey Ki-woo,
close the window!

1367
01:35:38,254 --> 01:35:40,340
You got shocked?

1368
01:35:47,263 --> 01:35:48,640
I'm dizzy.

1369
01:35:52,560 --> 01:35:56,314
Hold on a sec.
Wait.

1370
01:36:02,070 --> 01:36:03,655
Shit, I'm dizzy.

1371
01:36:07,909 --> 01:36:10,245
Ki-jung, be careful.

1372
01:36:11,913 --> 01:36:13,331
Don't touch anything.

1373
01:36:25,927 --> 01:36:31,683
Honey, I've got a concussion.

1374
01:36:31,933 --> 01:36:34,477
I can't see you.

1375
01:36:55,915 --> 01:37:00,295
Honey, that woman Chung-sook...

1376
01:37:01,045 --> 01:37:03,006
Oh, god.

1377
01:37:03,214 --> 01:37:05,216
What a nice person.

1378
01:37:07,135 --> 01:37:10,221
She kicked me
down the stairs.

1379
01:37:12,849 --> 01:37:14,809
Repeat after me.

1380
01:37:15,560 --> 01:37:18,021
Chung-sook...

1381
01:37:19,647 --> 01:37:23,026
Chung-sook...

1382
01:37:32,285 --> 01:37:34,245
Hey, Ki-woo!

1383
01:37:35,371 --> 01:37:36,748
What are you doing there?

1384
01:37:36,998 --> 01:37:37,957
Huh?

1385
01:37:53,181 --> 01:37:56,976
<i>h o l p... m...</i>

1386
01:39:02,584 --> 01:39:03,501
Dad.

1387
01:39:04,460 --> 01:39:05,420
Yeah?

1388
01:39:06,754 --> 01:39:10,216
What was your plan?

1389
01:39:12,093 --> 01:39:13,803
What are you talking about?

1390
01:39:15,054 --> 01:39:17,557
Before, you said you had a plan.

1391
01:39:18,099 --> 01:39:20,059
What will you do?
About...

1392
01:39:20,977 --> 01:39:21,853
the basement.

1393
01:39:22,895 --> 01:39:28,651
Ki-woo, you know what kind
of plan never fails?

1394
01:39:30,570 --> 01:39:33,072
No plan at all.

1395
01:39:33,197 --> 01:39:34,532
<i>No plan.</i>

1396
01:39:35,408 --> 01:39:36,576
You know why?

1397
01:39:38,620 --> 01:39:45,335
If you make a plan,
life never works out that way.

1398
01:39:46,085 --> 01:39:47,378
Look around us.

1399
01:39:48,004 --> 01:39:53,551
Did these people think,
"Let's all spend the night in a gym?"

1400
01:39:54,427 --> 01:39:56,054
But look now.

1401
01:39:56,512 --> 01:40:00,183
Everyone's sleeping
on the floor, us included.

1402
01:40:02,101 --> 01:40:05,188
That's why people
shouldn't make plans.

1403
01:40:07,315 --> 01:40:11,194
With no plan,
nothing can go wrong.

1404
01:40:11,444 --> 01:40:17,992
And if something spins out
of control, it doesn't matter.

1405
01:40:19,160 --> 01:40:21,996
Whether you kill someone,
or betray your country.

1406
01:40:23,539 --> 01:40:27,126
None of it fucking matters.
Got it?

1407
01:40:29,170 --> 01:40:30,296
Dad.

1408
01:40:32,632 --> 01:40:33,925
I'm sorry.

1409
01:40:34,842 --> 01:40:36,386
For what?

1410
01:40:39,639 --> 01:40:41,015
Everything.

1411
01:40:42,058 --> 01:40:43,518
All of it.

1412
01:40:45,853 --> 01:40:47,814
I'll take care of everything.

1413
01:40:48,690 --> 01:40:50,608
What are you talking about?

1414
01:40:52,777 --> 01:40:55,238
Why are you hugging
that stone?

1415
01:40:56,197 --> 01:40:57,532
This?

1416
01:41:03,287 --> 01:41:06,249
It keeps clinging to me.

1417
01:41:08,584 --> 01:41:12,672
I think you need some sleep.

1418
01:41:15,800 --> 01:41:17,260
I'm serious.

1419
01:41:19,178 --> 01:41:21,431
It keeps following me.

1420
01:41:33,901 --> 01:41:36,696
Miss Jessica!
Sorry to call on Sunday morning.

1421
01:41:36,738 --> 01:41:39,198
Are you free for lunch today?

1422
01:41:39,240 --> 01:41:42,660
<i>We're having a birthday
impromptu for Da-song.</i>

1423
01:41:44,537 --> 01:41:46,289
A birthday party?

1424
01:41:46,414 --> 01:41:49,500
If you come too,
Da-song will be so happy.

1425
01:41:50,042 --> 01:41:53,796
And have as much pasta, gratin,
and salmon steak as you want.

1426
01:41:54,255 --> 01:41:56,382
<i>Please come by 1PM,</i>

1427
01:41:56,507 --> 01:41:59,302
and I'll count today as
one of your lessons.

1428
01:41:59,510 --> 01:42:01,888
<i>You know what I mean?</i>
See you soon!

1429
01:42:03,514 --> 01:42:04,807
- Mom.
- Yeah?

1430
01:42:05,057 --> 01:42:08,728
For the impromptu,
should we invite Kevin too?

1431
01:42:08,770 --> 01:42:11,230
Great idea! <i>Why not?</i>
Will you call him?

1432
01:42:11,647 --> 01:42:15,401
Get some more sleep, honey!
You must be tired after yesterday.

1433
01:42:15,651 --> 01:42:19,697
If we have a party,
won't you need to do the rounds?

1434
01:42:19,864 --> 01:42:23,993
Right, the wine shop,
supermarket, bakery, florist...

1435
01:42:24,160 --> 01:42:27,413
But I already told Mr. Kim
to hurry over.

1436
01:42:27,872 --> 01:42:29,332
I'll pay him overtime.

1437
01:42:29,457 --> 01:42:30,416
<i>Perfect.</i>

1438
01:42:40,968 --> 01:42:44,639
Everyone sit down, I'll explain!

1439
01:42:45,264 --> 01:42:50,561
<i>Da-hye: We're having a party,
and mom said to invite you!</i>

1440
01:42:52,897 --> 01:42:55,942
<i>Sis, in the basement...</i>

1441
01:42:56,317 --> 01:42:58,528
we have 10 outdoor tables.

1442
01:42:58,694 --> 01:43:02,240
First take them all out,
then arrange them...

1443
01:43:03,199 --> 01:43:06,077
No, come to the window.
I need to show you.

1444
01:43:08,120 --> 01:43:09,872
With Da-song's tent in the middle,

1445
01:43:09,997 --> 01:43:13,292
curve the tables outward...

1446
01:43:13,835 --> 01:43:15,461
A crane's wing formation!

1447
01:43:15,920 --> 01:43:18,965
Like Admiral Yi used, you know?
The Battle of Hansan Island!

1448
01:43:19,423 --> 01:43:21,801
Think of the tent as
the Japanese warship.

1449
01:43:21,926 --> 01:43:27,056
And our tables will make a
semicircular crane's wing formation.

1450
01:43:27,348 --> 01:43:31,477
Then near the tent will be the
barbeque grill, firewood and such.

1451
01:43:31,644 --> 01:43:33,604
Arrange them all there!

1452
01:43:34,313 --> 01:43:37,567
Oh sure,
bring your husband too!

1453
01:43:37,650 --> 01:43:38,317
Yeah.

1454
01:43:38,734 --> 01:43:42,321
And definitely no presents,
just come!

1455
01:43:42,446 --> 01:43:43,072
Yeah.

1456
01:43:43,239 --> 01:43:45,324
What dress code?

1457
01:43:45,366 --> 01:43:48,619
It's an impromptu.
You can wear sweat pants!

1458
01:43:49,871 --> 01:43:55,418
And definitely no presents!
Just come and eat hors d'oeuvres!

1459
01:43:56,836 --> 01:43:58,629
You know my culinary skills!

1460
01:43:59,046 --> 01:44:03,843
Right!
We'll get drunk in the daytime.

1461
01:44:04,260 --> 01:44:04,927
Yeah.

1462
01:44:05,386 --> 01:44:08,931
If you'd sing, that'd be grand!
You know the one...

1463
01:44:24,989 --> 01:44:27,742
Quiet, he's sleeping!

1464
01:44:28,659 --> 01:44:31,537
Today the sky's so blue,
and no pollution!

1465
01:44:31,787 --> 01:44:33,664
Thanks to all the rain yesterday.

1466
01:44:34,999 --> 01:44:35,958
Right.

1467
01:44:36,375 --> 01:44:40,129
So we traded camping
for a garden party.

1468
01:44:41,505 --> 01:44:42,965
Lemons into lemonade.

1469
01:44:46,427 --> 01:44:51,140
Right, that rain
was such a blessing!

1470
01:44:52,683 --> 01:44:57,188
And definitely no presents,
I mean it!

1471
01:44:57,897 --> 01:45:01,567
Right, just squeeze your
Mini Cooper into the garage.

1472
01:45:01,609 --> 01:45:03,152
Go on up!

1473
01:45:03,319 --> 01:45:08,199
Right, back it in.
Just don't block the Benz!

1474
01:45:08,449 --> 01:45:12,578
You're here!
It's been so long!

1475
01:45:13,955 --> 01:45:16,415
I told you no presents!

1476
01:45:34,767 --> 01:45:36,602
You were thinking of
something else.

1477
01:45:37,144 --> 01:45:38,187
What?

1478
01:45:39,271 --> 01:45:42,817
While kissing me,
you thought of something else.

1479
01:45:44,860 --> 01:45:45,736
No.

1480
01:45:46,862 --> 01:45:50,449
What do you mean?
You're doing it now, too.

1481
01:45:53,160 --> 01:45:54,245
Wow.

1482
01:45:56,163 --> 01:45:58,541
Everyone looks gorgeous, right?

1483
01:46:00,001 --> 01:46:03,754
Even for a sudden gathering,
they're so cool.

1484
01:46:04,964 --> 01:46:06,966
And look so natural.

1485
01:46:09,093 --> 01:46:10,261
Da-hye.

1486
01:46:13,180 --> 01:46:14,473
Do I fit in here?

1487
01:46:16,308 --> 01:46:17,560
What?

1488
01:46:18,519 --> 01:46:21,564
In this setting, do I fit in?

1489
01:46:31,699 --> 01:46:33,659
Hey, where are you going?

1490
01:46:34,201 --> 01:46:35,453
I need to go down.

1491
01:46:35,995 --> 01:46:37,997
Just stay with me.

1492
01:46:39,331 --> 01:46:40,875
I need to go down there.

1493
01:46:41,625 --> 01:46:46,297
Why go to those boring people?
Can't you stay here?

1494
01:46:47,214 --> 01:46:51,594
Not to those people,
down lower.

1495
01:46:52,053 --> 01:46:54,597
Wow, what is that?

1496
01:46:57,850 --> 01:47:01,520
God, I can't believe
I'm doing this at my age.

1497
01:47:02,146 --> 01:47:04,023
It's so embarrassing.

1498
01:47:05,149 --> 01:47:06,692
I'm really sorry, Mr. Kim.

1499
01:47:06,942 --> 01:47:10,112
Da-song's mom insisted,
it can't be helped.

1500
01:47:10,237 --> 01:47:11,906
But the concept is simple.

1501
01:47:11,947 --> 01:47:17,203
There'll be a parade with
Jessica carrying a birthday cake.

1502
01:47:17,369 --> 01:47:21,332
Then we jump out
and attack Jessica.

1503
01:47:21,457 --> 01:47:23,501
Swinging our tomahawks!

1504
01:47:23,751 --> 01:47:24,627
Right.

1505
01:47:24,668 --> 01:47:29,715
Just then, Da-song the good Indian
will jump out and we'll do battle.

1506
01:47:30,257 --> 01:47:34,637
Finally he'll save Jessica the
cake princess, and they'll all cheer.

1507
01:47:34,887 --> 01:47:36,138
Something like that.

1508
01:47:37,681 --> 01:47:38,724
Silly, isn't it?

1509
01:47:38,766 --> 01:47:43,562
I guess your wife likes
events and surprises.

1510
01:47:43,687 --> 01:47:45,439
Yeah, she does.

1511
01:47:45,898 --> 01:47:48,567
But she's particularly into this party.

1512
01:47:50,111 --> 01:47:53,072
You're trying your best, too.

1513
01:47:54,406 --> 01:47:57,076
Well, you love her,
after all.

1514
01:48:02,623 --> 01:48:03,666
Mr. Kim.

1515
01:48:05,709 --> 01:48:07,962
You're getting paid extra.

1516
01:48:13,509 --> 01:48:17,471
Think of this as
part of your work, okay?

1517
01:48:29,150 --> 01:48:30,609
Did you go down below?

1518
01:48:30,901 --> 01:48:34,697
- Not yet.
- Shouldn't we talk to them?

1519
01:48:34,738 --> 01:48:36,490
Reach an understanding?

1520
01:48:36,657 --> 01:48:37,616
Exactly!

1521
01:48:37,658 --> 01:48:40,494
We all got too fucking
worked up last night.

1522
01:48:40,536 --> 01:48:44,123
Dad was going on
about some plan...

1523
01:48:44,915 --> 01:48:47,209
- I'm just going down there.
- Hold on.

1524
01:48:47,459 --> 01:48:49,587
Take this down to them.

1525
01:48:49,753 --> 01:48:51,422
- They must be hungry.
- Right.

1526
01:48:51,463 --> 01:48:53,090
Let them eat first.

1527
01:48:55,342 --> 01:48:56,635
Come next time for sure!

1528
01:48:57,678 --> 01:48:59,722
Here you are, Jessica.

1529
01:48:59,847 --> 01:49:01,891
- This is so amazing.
- Isn't it great?

1530
01:49:02,266 --> 01:49:04,727
I've got a special favor to ask.

1531
01:49:04,852 --> 01:49:05,811
What is it?

1532
01:49:06,061 --> 01:49:08,314
This is... how to describe it?

1533
01:49:08,480 --> 01:49:10,149
Da-song's trauma recovery cake?

1534
01:49:10,482 --> 01:49:13,652
So it needs to be you who does it.
Today's highlight!

1535
01:50:36,777 --> 01:50:39,989
Hey, are you okay?

1536
01:50:45,369 --> 01:50:46,537
Are you...?

1537
01:50:56,588 --> 01:50:57,840
Wait, mister!

1538
01:52:45,197 --> 01:52:47,866
Kevin? Kevin!

1539
01:52:54,706 --> 01:52:57,459
Da-song, <i>happy birthday!</i>

1540
01:52:57,584 --> 01:52:58,752
Congratulations!

1541
01:53:06,427 --> 01:53:07,469
Shit...

1542
01:53:17,521 --> 01:53:19,481
<i>Stop!</i>

1543
01:53:19,606 --> 01:53:21,775
Chung-sook!

1544
01:53:21,817 --> 01:53:22,651
Ki-jung!

1545
01:53:22,734 --> 01:53:24,194
Come out here, Chung-sook!

1546
01:53:24,236 --> 01:53:27,698
Stop the blood!
Push down on the wound!

1547
01:53:32,536 --> 01:53:33,370
Da-song!

1548
01:53:34,413 --> 01:53:35,205
Honey!

1549
01:53:37,040 --> 01:53:38,792
Let go, don't!

1550
01:53:49,761 --> 01:53:51,180
It hurts.

1551
01:53:56,351 --> 01:53:57,311
The emergency room!

1552
01:53:57,436 --> 01:53:58,729
Get the car!

1553
01:53:58,770 --> 01:54:00,731
Mr. Kim!
What are you doing?

1554
01:54:00,939 --> 01:54:02,441
We can't wait for an ambulance!

1555
01:54:02,941 --> 01:54:05,110
Stop pushing, Dad!

1556
01:54:05,360 --> 01:54:08,030
Makes it hurt more.

1557
01:54:09,072 --> 01:54:10,032
Car keys!
The car keys!

1558
01:54:10,157 --> 01:54:12,951
Throw them!
Throw me the keys!

1559
01:54:30,761 --> 01:54:32,054
Are you okay?

1560
01:54:32,596 --> 01:54:34,056
Don't touch it!

1561
01:54:36,517 --> 01:54:38,644
Hello, Mr. Park.

1562
01:54:39,102 --> 01:54:39,978
You know me?

1563
01:54:40,312 --> 01:54:41,647
<i>Respect!</i>

1564
01:56:08,609 --> 01:56:12,070
<i>Opening my eyes for
the first time in a month,</i>

1565
01:56:12,112 --> 01:56:13,572
<i>I saw a detective.</i>

1566
01:56:14,072 --> 01:56:18,869
You have the right
to an attorney...

1567
01:56:18,910 --> 01:56:20,871
<i>Who looked nothing
like a detective.</i>

1568
01:56:25,500 --> 01:56:27,169
Is he laughing?

1569
01:56:27,586 --> 01:56:28,879
Just a sec.

1570
01:56:29,630 --> 01:56:34,176
<i>Then the doctor who looked
nothing like a doctor spoke.</i>

1571
01:56:35,510 --> 01:56:39,097
That happens sometimes
after brain surgery.

1572
01:56:39,431 --> 01:56:41,391
They keep laughing.
For no reason.

1573
01:56:42,309 --> 01:56:44,186
Do you hear me?

1574
01:56:44,728 --> 01:56:46,271
Can you hear me?

1575
01:56:46,730 --> 01:56:48,482
Then do I have to do it again?

1576
01:56:48,649 --> 01:56:49,399
Do what?

1577
01:56:49,524 --> 01:56:50,776
The Miranda thing.

1578
01:56:53,320 --> 01:56:57,491
You have the right to remain silent.

1579
01:56:57,532 --> 01:57:00,202
Anything you say can and
will be used against you...

1580
01:57:00,410 --> 01:57:02,412
He keeps laughing, look!

1581
01:57:05,749 --> 01:57:11,588
<i>Even when I heard how much
Ki-jung bled that day...</i>

1582
01:57:14,049 --> 01:57:21,223
<i>Even when I heard the words forgery,
trespassing, foul play, self-defense</i>

1583
01:57:21,556 --> 01:57:25,602
<i>and we were lucky to
get away with a probation...</i>

1584
01:57:28,939 --> 01:57:32,025
<i>Even when I finally
got to see Ki-jung's face...</i>

1585
01:57:32,067 --> 01:57:34,736
<i>Kim Ki-jung, RIP</i>

1586
01:57:36,488 --> 01:57:38,615
<i>I kept laughing.</i>

1587
01:57:48,583 --> 01:57:53,839
<i>Still, when I went back and
watched the news reports,</i>

1588
01:57:54,214 --> 01:57:55,340
<i>I didn't laugh.</i>

1589
01:57:55,507 --> 01:57:59,553
This sudden rampage in the
back yard of an upper-class home

1590
01:57:59,678 --> 01:58:01,263
is a highly unusual case.

1591
01:58:01,388 --> 01:58:05,767
Since the homeless man who sparked
the rampage died at the scene,

1592
01:58:05,892 --> 01:58:11,273
police are struggling to even
establish a clear motive.

1593
01:58:11,314 --> 01:58:15,777
The driver Kim and the slain Mr. Park
are said to have been on good terms.

1594
01:58:15,902 --> 01:58:21,074
For now the police investigation is
focused on locating the driver Kim.

1595
01:58:21,825 --> 01:58:25,454
Kim, after exiting this door
and descending the stairs,

1596
01:58:25,829 --> 01:58:28,999
disappeared into the
neighboring alleys.

1597
01:58:29,833 --> 01:58:34,671
Police searched the CCTVs
of nearby homes to no avail,

1598
01:58:35,338 --> 01:58:38,300
and they have yet
to find any witnesses.

1599
01:58:39,050 --> 01:58:41,011
Given the situation,

1600
01:58:41,344 --> 01:58:46,308
it's not an exaggeration to say
that Kim vanished into thin air.

1601
01:58:47,768 --> 01:58:54,691
<i>Actually Mom and I had
no idea where Dad was.</i>

1602
01:58:56,943 --> 01:59:02,407
<i>But those detectives still
wore themselves out tailing us.</i>

1603
01:59:06,536 --> 01:59:12,417
<i>Eventually the news went quiet,
and after the tails stopped,</i>

1604
01:59:13,084 --> 01:59:16,338
<i>I started going up that mountain.</i>

1605
01:59:18,590 --> 01:59:23,136
<i>From up there, you get
a great view of the house.</i>

1606
01:59:26,181 --> 01:59:33,271
<i>That day, despite the cold,
I felt like staying longer.</i>

1607
01:59:46,409 --> 01:59:49,871
Dash-dash-dot-dot

1608
02:00:15,230 --> 02:00:16,314
Son!

1609
02:00:18,525 --> 02:00:19,693
<i>Son!</i>

1610
02:00:22,028 --> 02:00:25,574
<i>Perhaps you, if no one else,
will be able to read this letter.</i>

1611
02:00:29,160 --> 02:00:35,417
<i>You were a Boy Scout,
so I'm writing this just in case.</i>

1612
02:00:38,753 --> 02:00:41,423
<i>Have your injuries healed?</i>

1613
02:00:42,674 --> 02:00:46,720
<i>I'm sure your mom
is plenty healthy.</i>

1614
02:00:50,849 --> 02:00:53,602
<i>I'm doing fine in here.</i>

1615
02:00:54,686 --> 02:00:57,355
<i>Though thinking
of Ki-jung makes me cry.</i>

1616
02:01:00,775 --> 02:01:05,238
<i>Even now, what happened
that day doesn't seem real.</i>

1617
02:01:06,573 --> 02:01:08,241
<i>It feels like a dream,</i>

1618
02:01:09,910 --> 02:01:11,745
<i>and yet it doesn't.</i>

1619
02:01:13,079 --> 02:01:17,751
<i>That day as I went out the gate,
I suddenly knew.</i>

1620
02:01:18,793 --> 02:01:20,545
<i>Where I needed to go...</i>

1621
02:02:00,251 --> 02:02:03,296
<i>A house where such
a grisly crime took place</i>

1622
02:02:03,338 --> 02:02:06,299
<i>would surely not
be easy to sell.</i>

1623
02:02:09,761 --> 02:02:12,013
I'm sorry, Mr. Park.

1624
02:02:12,263 --> 02:02:18,436
<i>I struggled to hold out
like that in an empty house.</i>

1625
02:02:21,272 --> 02:02:24,317
<i>Still, thanks to
the house being empty,</i>

1626
02:02:24,359 --> 02:02:29,239
<i>what was her name?
Moon-gwang?</i>

1627
02:02:29,280 --> 02:02:33,243
<i>I was able to give her
a proper send off.</i>

1628
02:02:34,744 --> 02:02:41,126
<i>I hear tree-side burials are trendy,
so hell, I did my best.</i>

1629
02:02:44,796 --> 02:02:48,341
<i>But those real estate sharks
sure are clever.</i>

1630
02:02:52,971 --> 02:02:57,475
<i>They hoodwinked some people
who had just arrived in Korea</i>

1631
02:02:57,517 --> 02:02:59,561
<i>and managed to sell the house.</i>

1632
02:03:01,021 --> 02:03:04,357
<i>With the parents working,
and the kids attending school,</i>

1633
02:03:04,399 --> 02:03:06,651
<i>the family is usually out.</i>

1634
02:03:07,110 --> 02:03:12,157
<i>But the goddamned housekeeper
stays there 24 hours a day.</i>

1635
02:03:12,699 --> 02:03:17,287
<i>Each time I go upstairs,
I take my life in my hands.</i>

1636
02:03:20,123 --> 02:03:24,169
<i>It turns out Germans eat more
than just sausage and beer.</i>

1637
02:03:24,836 --> 02:03:26,755
<i>What a relief.</i>

1638
02:03:29,632 --> 02:03:33,678
<i>Passing the time down here,
everything starts to go hazy.</i>

1639
02:03:38,308 --> 02:03:42,395
<i>Today at least
I was able to write you a letter.</i>

1640
02:03:44,314 --> 02:03:48,276
<i>If I send out the letter
this way every night,</i>

1641
02:03:48,318 --> 02:03:52,405
<i>maybe someday you'll see it.</i>

1642
02:03:58,536 --> 02:04:00,538
<i>So long.</i>

1643
02:04:14,385 --> 02:04:15,553
You're home, Ki-woo?

1644
02:04:15,595 --> 02:04:16,221
Yeah.

1645
02:04:30,985 --> 02:04:35,740
<i>Dad, today I made a plan.</i>

1646
02:04:37,283 --> 02:04:39,244
<i>A fundamental plan.</i>

1647
02:04:42,288 --> 02:04:43,957
<i>I'm going to earn money.</i>

1648
02:04:44,874 --> 02:04:46,334
<i>A lot of it.</i>

1649
02:04:49,921 --> 02:04:54,384
<i>University, a career, marriage,
those are all fine,</i>

1650
02:04:54,884 --> 02:04:56,845
<i>but first I'll earn money.</i>

1651
02:04:57,011 --> 02:05:01,975
You'll see once you go in,
but it's very spacious.

1652
02:05:02,809 --> 02:05:07,480
Actually, we don't show
this house to just anyone.

1653
02:05:07,730 --> 02:05:11,901
<i>When I have money,
I'll buy that house.</i>

1654
02:05:13,027 --> 02:05:17,198
<i>On the day we move in,
Mom and I will be in the yard.</i>

1655
02:05:17,824 --> 02:05:20,118
<i>Because the sunshine
is so nice there.</i>

1656
02:05:21,661 --> 02:05:23,371
<i>All you'll need to do</i>

1657
02:05:23,830 --> 02:05:26,416
<i>is walk up the stairs.</i>

1658
02:06:49,332 --> 02:06:53,169
<i>Take care until then.</i>

1659
02:06:58,132 --> 02:06:59,968
<i>So long.</i>
